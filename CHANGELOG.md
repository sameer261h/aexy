### Public forms render again, and the task @-mention field no longer freezes

Three related fixes to public forms and the task description editor:

- **Public forms returned 404 even when active.** Both the legacy
  ticket-forms module and the newer Forms module publish under the
  same `/public/forms/{token}` URL, and their two API routers each
  registered `GET /public/forms/{token}`. The ticket-forms router is
  mounted first, so it handled *every* request — any form built in the
  Forms module missed the `ticket_forms` table and 404'd, regardless of
  its Active/visibility toggle. The public endpoints (get, submit,
  verify-email) now resolve a token against ticket-forms first and fall
  back to the Forms module, so both systems are reachable through the
  shared public page.
- **The task description `@`-mention selector got stuck.** Typing `@`
  opened the mention dropdown but then swallowed every subsequent
  keystroke, leaving the field unusable. The Tiptap key handler was
  reading stale state (the editor captures its options once) and
  `return true`-ing on each character, which blocked the editor from
  inserting text; the dropdown was also clipped by the container's
  `overflow-hidden`. The handler now reads live values via refs, never
  blocks typing, and the dropdown is no longer clipped.
- **Forms-module field types rendered as plain text.** On the shared
  public page, `phone`, `url`, and `datetime` now use the correct input
  types, `radio` renders a proper option group, and `hidden` fields are
  no longer shown as text boxes — their `default_value` is seeded and
  submitted instead. Field default values are now applied on load in
  general.

## [0.8.42] - 2026-07-05

### Marketing site is now crawlable and shareable (SEO)

The homepage shipped almost no server-rendered content — it gated its
entire body behind a client-side `isChecking` spinner, so a crawler
(or any no-JS fetch) saw only the page title and zero links. The
content now renders unconditionally in the server response (real
headings, the FAQ, and the full internal link graph including the
GitHub repo); logged-in visitors are redirected to the app at the
edge (middleware, `aexy_authed` cookie) instead of behind a render
gate.

Alongside that:

- **robots.txt and sitemap.xml** now exist (`app/robots.ts`,
  `app/sitemap.ts`) — robots allows the public marketing routes and
  disallows the authenticated app; the sitemap lists the real public
  URLs.
- **Open Graph & Twitter Card** tags, a **canonical** link, and
  **`WebApplication` JSON-LD** (with `offers`/`featureList`) were
  added to the root metadata, so shared links render a card and
  Google can build a rich result. The title now includes the ICP
  keywords (engineering, CRM, HR, GTM) within the display limit and
  the meta description fits in ~130 characters.
- **favicon** (`favicon.ico` + `icon.svg`) and a dynamic **Open
  Graph image** were added — all previously 404'd.
- **HSTS** (`Strict-Transport-Security`) is now emitted by the app,
  and responses are **gzip-compressed** (`compress`). Hashed
  `/_next/static/*` chunks are served `immutable` so repeat visitors
  stop re-downloading the JS bundles.

The nginx template also gained a `www → apex` redirect, immutable
static-asset caching, and a broader gzip type list. Note: `www`
still needs a DNS record to resolve, and the marketing HTML itself
remains dynamically rendered (a consequence of per-request i18n) —
tracked for a future locale-routing change.

## [0.8.41] - 2026-07-05

### Workspace module toggles are now enforced on the API

Disabling a module for a workspace (App Access settings) only hid it
from the sidebar — the underlying API kept serving it, so a member
could still read and write a "disabled" module by calling it
directly. The toggle is now enforced server-side via a shared
`require_app_access` dependency (plus `ensure_app_enabled` for
endpoints that resolve their workspace from the request body or a
referenced entity).

Enforcement covers every router of a gated app, not just its primary
one: disabling **Sprints** now also blocks epics, stories, bugs,
releases, sprint analytics, planning poker and retrospectives;
**Docs** covers documents, templates, collaboration and document
spaces; **Tickets** covers ticket forms and escalation. Tracking is
enforced where the workspace is resolved server-side (standups,
blockers, time, dashboards) rather than via a query param that most
of its routes never receive. An unknown app id now fails at startup
instead of silently disabling enforcement, and the workspace's
`app_settings` are read through a short-lived in-process cache with
cross-process invalidation (Redis pub/sub) so a toggle takes effect
immediately across workers.

The frontend guard was aligned to the same rule: it now blocks a
route only on the workspace-level toggle (not on a member's role
bundle), so members are no longer redirected off modules the API
would happily serve.

### "My Work" page

New `/my-work` page listing everything assigned to the current user
across sprint tasks, bugs and stories in one view, with a "show
completed" toggle. Terminal bug statuses (`verified`, `closed`,
`wont_fix`, `duplicate`, `cannot_reproduce`) are excluded from the
default view via a shared constant, and finished bugs no longer show
as open work. Each query is capped so a long-tenured user can't pull
their entire history in one response.

### Integration connect no longer blocks or mis-maps

Connecting Jira or Linear ran a full issue sync inline in the connect
request, so a large project could time the request out (and a retry
then hit "integration already exists"), and a mid-sync failure left
the request's DB session poisoned. The initial sync now runs in the
background on its own session, so connect returns immediately. The
"map the primary team to the first remote project when nothing
matches by name" fallback was removed — unmatched teams get no
mapping rather than silently importing an unrelated project's issues.

### Bug fixes

- **`PATCH /developers/me` returned 500.** Updating your own profile
  expired the eagerly-loaded connection relationships and then
  lazy-loaded them during serialization; the update now re-fetches
  with the relationships loaded.
- **Analytics endpoints returned 500 on every call.** The skill
  heatmap, productivity trends and collaboration network endpoints
  read request fields that didn't exist on their schemas; the
  productivity/collaboration queries also mis-built their
  `date_trunc`/`cast` expressions. All now work.
- **Slack webhooks 500'd on bad input.** `/slack/events` with
  malformed JSON now returns 400, and `/slack/commands` with a
  missing signature timestamp returns 401, instead of crashing.
- **`GET /developers/{id}` with a malformed id** now returns 404
  instead of 500.
- **Developer efficiency metrics** could raise when mixing
  timezone-aware and naive timestamps; datetimes are normalized to
  UTC before comparison.
- **Task GitHub links** were fetched and rendered twice in the task
  modal under two query keys, so linking/unlinking left one list
  stale; the section is now a single source of truth.
- **Blocker analytics** counted recently-resolved blockers as active
  after the active-blockers endpoint began returning both; the
  analytics page and dashboard count only unresolved blockers again.
- **Epic linked-task rows** linked to a broken URL; they now point at
  the correct project/sprint board.

### Testing

The backend test suite can now run against real Postgres (set
`TEST_DATABASE_URL`), catching pgvector/JSONB/UUID/`date_trunc` and
foreign-key behavior SQLite silently ignores; the full unit and
integration suites pass on both SQLite and Postgres.
## [0.8.40] - 2026-06-17

### Added

#### Aexy Tracker — macOS work tracker + AI auto-attribution
A local-first macOS menu-bar app that captures lightweight semantic signals (frontmost app, window title, file/git context, dev/browser context, idle state) and uploads them as append-only, idempotent event batches. A downstream Temporal/LLM pipeline enriches, attributes, and narrates the activity so time tracking happens with no manual entry.

- **macOS client** (`aexy-mac/`, Swift): durable local buffer, batched idempotent upload, OAuth device-code onboarding, Keychain-persisted config, and best-effort nil-safe collectors. Events are removed from the buffer only after the server confirms them.
- **Ingest API** (`/tracker/*`): device enrollment, partial-success batch ingest (idempotent on `event_id`), heartbeat/config pull, sync high-water mark, and evidence presign. Sliding-window rate limiting (fail-open) and a 30d-past/5m-future timestamp guard. `category`/`attribution` are server-derived only — never accepted from the client.
- **Enrich/attribute loop** (Temporal + LLM): collapses consecutive samples into spans, categorizes them (productive/neutral/personal), and attributes each to a candidate task — rolled up into inferred `TimeEntry` rows that show in the existing tracking module. Fire-and-forget per-batch dispatch (time-bucketed `workflow_id` coalescing) plus a 5-min safety-net sweep.
- **Daily journal + proactive insights**: an LLM narrative per developer per day (idempotent `WorkLog` upsert), and deterministic insight signals (context switching, meeting load, after-hours, focus fragmentation) surfaced as deduped in-app notifications.
- **Q&A + auto-attributed timesheet** (`/tracker/qa`, `/tracker/timesheet`): individual-scoped natural-language Q&A over one's own journals + inferred time, and a day-grouped timesheet view with confidence badges. New `/tracking/tracker` UI page + `useTrackerTimesheet` hook.
- **Confirm / correct attribution**: the timesheet is now a review queue — confirm the AI's task guess, reassign it (`TaskSelect` fed by `GET /tracker/candidate-tasks`), or dismiss it, via `PATCH /tracker/timesheet/entries/{id}` and a new `attribution_status` column. Dismissed entries drop out of totals. Page fully localized (`tracking.tracker` namespace, en/hi); Q&A now follows the selected date range and the date picker no longer shifts a day in non-UTC zones.
- **Browser sign-in (macOS app)**: **Sign in → GitHub / Google / Microsoft** opens the system browser to the new `GET /auth/device/login?provider=&port=`, captures the developer JWT on a `127.0.0.1` loopback listener (RFC 8252), exchanges it for a long-lived `aexy_…` API token (`POST /developers/me/api-tokens`), and enrolls — no env vars or manual code entry. Replaces the dead device-code default that 404'd.
- **Docs**: `docs/aexy-tracker.md` (feature + macOS client + sign-in) and `docs/api/tracker-ingest.md` (ingest + device-login contract), linked into the handbook nav; code references repointed to them.
- **Desktop companion (Aexy for macOS)**: the macOS app (renamed to **Aexy**, in `aexy-mac/`) is now a hybrid companion — web sign-in, native Today/Board(Kanban)/Table/Docs/Time/Standups, native notifications, and embedded web for everything else. The web app gains a **chromeless `?embed=true` mode** — `AppShell` hides its sidebar, and the **docs layout + `DocumentEditor`** hide the docs sidebar/title-header so the embedded editor is editor-only — letting the desktop app's native sidebar be the sole navigation with full web parity.

### Fixed

- **Security (OAuth redirect):** the post-login redirect now delivers the developer JWT only to an allowlisted target — the configured frontend, local dev, ops-configured `OAUTH_EXTRA_REDIRECT_HOSTS`, or a `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` loopback (native apps). All provider login/connect entry points reject a disallowed `redirect_url` with `400`, and every callback funnels through one guarded chokepoint, closing a token-exfiltration vector where an attacker-supplied `redirect_url` could capture a victim's token.
- Tracker enrich now locks pending event rows (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`) and is backstopped by a partial unique index on inferred `time_entries` dedupe keys, so the per-batch dispatch and the periodic sweep can't double-attribute the same events into duplicate time entries.
- Tracker enrich tolerates non-numeric LLM `confidence` values instead of crashing (and Temporal-retrying) the whole activity.
- Tracker timesheet no longer leaks daily journals dated after the requested `end` date (added the missing upper `logged_at` bound).
- Tracker ingest counts within-batch duplicates so `accepted + duplicates + rejected` reconciles to events sent; insight runs no longer overcount notifications suppressed by recipient preferences.
- macOS client: onboarding completes when the server mints no enroll token (falls back to the device-code token), the local buffer is capped to bound offline growth, and the sample interval is clamped to the server's accepted `1…600s` range.

## [0.8.39] - 2026-05-28

### Pick destination status when moving a task across projects

Cross-project move (0.8.34) silently re-resolved the new task's
status to the destination's first "open" status. For sibling boards
that's fine; for cross-board moves (Product → Tech) the user
usually has a specific column in mind and the default was wrong.

`MoveToProjectModal` now fetches the destination project's status
set via the existing `useTaskStatuses` hook once a target is
picked, and renders a "Status on destination board" dropdown. The
default selection follows: same slug on the target → same name
(case-insensitive) → first active status by position. The picked
slug rides through as `target_status_slug` on both the single and
bulk move requests; the backend (`SprintTaskService.move_to_project`)
validates it against `TaskConfigService.get_statuses_for_project`
before any write, raising `invalid_target_status` (400) on
mismatch. Bulk move applies one status to every cloned task.

`_clone_task_to_project` now accepts an `override_status_slug` and
short-circuits the open-status resolver when supplied. Subtasks
under `cascade` still resolve their own open status — the picker is
parent-only, which matches the existing "subtasks inherit the
destination's defaults" semantics.

### Archive view on the project board and workspace All-Tasks tab

`SprintTask.is_archived` and the unarchive endpoint have existed
since the early sprint module, but no UI ever surfaced archived
rows. Once a task was archived (manually or as part of a cross-
project move), it disappeared.

Both `/sprints/[projectId]/board` and the workspace All-Tasks tab
get an `Active | Archived` segmented toggle (URL-synced via
`?view=archived` so reloads and link-shares round-trip). In
archived view:

- The kanban is replaced by `TaskTableView` — archived rows don't
  belong in status columns, and the table is the right surface for
  a flat list. The Board/Table layout toggle, Sprints/Status
  view-mode toggle, Add Task, Columns shortcut, Import button, and
  priority/labels/epics filters are all hidden (search, assignee,
  project, sprint stay). On the board page this is driven by a new
  `minimal` flag on the existing `FilterBar` component.
- Each row has an Unarchive icon-button; the bulk-action toolbar on
  the workspace tab gains an "Restore selected" entry that fires
  parallel unarchives.
- The workspace endpoint already accepted `include_archived`; both
  endpoints now also accept `archived_only`. `list_project_tasks`
  was hard-coded to `is_archived = false` — that's been generalized
  to the same flag pair. `archived_only` is strict regardless of
  `include_archived`.

New `useUnarchiveTask` hook wraps `projectTasksApi.unarchive` and
reuses `invalidateTaskCaches` so the active view re-fetches
correctly when a row is restored.

### Workload analytics no longer 500s

`POST /analytics/workload` was crashing with
`AttributeError: 'WorkloadRequest' object has no attribute 'days'`
because the handler read `request.days` but the schema didn't
declare the field. The frontend has been sending `days: 30` since
that endpoint shipped. Added `days: int = 30` to the schema.

## [0.8.38] - 2026-05-23

### Visible move-link on cross-project moves

Cross-project moves (shipped in 0.8.34) already created a
`task_dependencies` row linking the new task back to the source —
but nothing in the UI rendered that linkage. Anyone opening either
side of the move saw a context-free task.

`SprintTaskService.move_to_project` now prepends a one-line
"Moved from <KEY> — <title>" breadcrumb to the new task's
description and a matching "Moved to" line on the source. The
breadcrumb is written into both `description` (plain text) and
`description_json` (a ProseMirror paragraph with a `link` mark
pointing at `/sprints/<team>/board?task=<id>`) so every surface
that renders descriptions shows it without any extra UI plumbing.
Cascade subtasks each get their own pair of breadcrumbs pointing
at the corresponding clone — the parent's pointer alone wouldn't
reach the children.

The existing `task_dependencies` row is still recorded as the
structured source of truth for any future banner work.

### Docs sidebar: Recent apps + section-grouped app list

The flat "Apps" section in the docs sidebar (0.8.35) is replaced
with a sidebar that mirrors the main app sidebar's grouping —
Engineering / People / Business / AI / Compliance — plus a
"Recent" strip at the top tracking the user's last-visited apps.

Implementation:

- `recentAppsStore` (Zustand + localStorage, cap 8) records each
  app visit. Mounted once in `app/(app)/layout.tsx` via
  `useRecentApps()` so visits from any surface count.
- `NotionSidebar` reads the main sidebar's `GROUPED_LAYOUT`,
  applies the same persona filter (`useSidebarPersona`) and
  app-access filter (`useAppAccess`) the main sidebar uses, and
  renders each section collapsed by default to keep the docs
  surface focused.
- The Knowledge section is hidden in the docs sidebar (the docs
  sidebar IS the knowledge view; re-listing it would be
  tautological). Docs and Drive are filtered out of the Recent
  strip for the same reason.
- New `SidebarAppGroup` component renders apps with sub-items
  (Tracking → Standups/Blockers/Time, etc.) as expandable rows
  inside the section, matching the main sidebar's depth.

## [0.8.37] - 2026-05-23

### Doc editor no longer unmounts on every save

Reported: "after typing the doc refreshes and the cursor becomes
deselected".

Root cause was on the page, not the editor. `/docs/[documentId]/page.tsx`
was passing `isLoading={isUpdating}` to `DocumentEditor`, where
`isUpdating` is the mutation-pending flag from `useDocument`'s
`updateContent` mutation. `DocumentEditor` returns its loading skeleton
when `isLoading` is true — so every debounced autosave kicked off by
typing flipped `isUpdating` to true, the editor was replaced by the
skeleton, then `isUpdating` flipped back to false and the editor was
remounted — fresh TipTap instance, fresh selection, cursor lost.

Removed the prop. The page-level initial-load guard (above the
component) still shows a skeleton on first fetch; once the document
is loaded the editor stays mounted, and the in-editor "Saving… / Saved"
indicator reflects save state without tearing anything down.

## [0.8.36] - 2026-05-23

### Remove BubbleMenu from DocumentEditor (selection crash, take 2)

0.8.35 gated BubbleMenu on `editorMode === "rich"` thinking the
crash was a mode-switch race. The user kept hitting the same
`removeChild` error while selecting text in rich mode — the gate
fixed the switch path but not the steady-state path. Re-diagnosis:

- `@tiptap/react`'s `BubbleMenu` wraps Tippy.js.
- Tippy appends its tooltip node into `document.body`, outside the
  React tree.
- Every `selectionchange` causes BubbleMenu to remount its Tippy
  instance, moving DOM nodes between body and the editor.
- React's reconciler then tries to remove a node from a parent that
  no longer owns it → `NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild'
  on 'Node'` in the commit phase.

This is a known incompatibility between `@tiptap/react`'s BubbleMenu
and React 18+ concurrent reconciliation
(ueberdosis/tiptap#3580, #2658).

Removed the BubbleMenu entirely. The top `EditorToolbar` already
exposes Bold / Italic / Underline / Code, so the affordance isn't
lost — only the floating bubble. If we want the bubble UX back, the
replacement should use `@floating-ui/react` (in-tree positioning)
rather than Tippy.

## [0.8.35] - 2026-05-23

Two docs surface fixes.

### Apps escape-hatch in the docs sidebar

The main app sidebar is hidden on `/docs/*` routes, so the docs sidebar
(`NotionSidebar`) was the only navigation chrome — but it had no path
to other modules. Users had to back out via browser nav or memorize
URLs to jump to Sprints, CRM, etc.

Added a collapsed-by-default "Apps" section at the bottom of the docs
sidebar (above the divider before "Add space"). It reuses
`useAppAccess(workspaceId, developerId)` to list only the apps the
current user can access, with each row linking to that app's
`baseRoute` from `APP_CATALOG`. Same access logic as the main sidebar
— no new permissions surface.

### Selection bug — `removeChild` race on editor mode switch

Reported: selecting text in `/docs/[id]` would intermittently throw
`NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to
be removed is not a child of this node` in the React commit phase.

Root cause: `DocumentEditor`'s BubbleMenu was rendered when
`editor && !readOnly`, regardless of `editorMode`. In markdown mode
the `EditorContent` is replaced by a `<textarea>`, but the BubbleMenu
(and its Tippy.js portal) stayed mounted. Any subsequent `selectionchange`
would race React reconciliation — Tippy holds DOM references that React
no longer owns, the next reposition tries to `removeChild` a detached
node, and the commit phase throws.

Fix: gate BubbleMenu on `editorMode === "rich"` so it tears down
cleanly when the user switches modes. One-line conditional change in
`frontend/src/components/docs/DocumentEditor.tsx`.

## [0.8.34] - 2026-05-22

New: cross-project task move (fork + link). A task can now be moved to
another project in the same workspace; a fresh task is created in the
destination, linked back to the source as a "duplicates" dependency,
and the source is either archived or marked done at the operator's
choice.

### Why fork instead of true move

Moving the row in place would orphan the source's history, sprint
membership, comments, and attachments — and `task_key` is workspace-
scoped but tasks reference sprint/epic/story IDs that don't translate
across projects. A new task in the destination plus a `task_dependencies`
link preserves provenance while letting the destination start fresh.

### Backend

- `SprintTaskService.move_to_project(task_id, target_project_id,
  source_action, subtask_strategy, actor_id)` and a `bulk_move_to_project`
  variant that returns per-task results (one failure doesn't abort the
  batch). See plan `mutable-herding-flute.md` for the full contract.
- New endpoints in `api/project_tasks.py`:
  - `POST /teams/{team_id}/tasks/{task_id}/move-to-project`
  - `POST /teams/{team_id}/tasks/bulk-move-to-project`
- Stable error codes mapped to HTTP 400: `cross_workspace_move`,
  `same_project_move`, `target_project_not_found`,
  `task_already_archived`, `task_has_subtasks`,
  `source_task_not_found`, `invalid_source_action`,
  `invalid_subtask_strategy`.
- Subtask handling — caller picks per move:
  - `block` (default, safest) — reject the move if subtasks exist.
  - `cascade` — clone every active subtask into the destination under
    the new parent; archive each original subtask.
  - `orphan` — leave subtasks in place; their `parent_task_id` still
    points at the archived/done source.
- Source-action — caller picks per move:
  - `archive` — `is_archived=True` on the source.
  - `mark_done` — set the source's status to its project's first
    `semantics="done"` slug (workspace fallback, then canonical "done")
    and set `completed_at = now()` if null.
- Assignee on the new task is preserved only if the developer is a
  member of the target project; otherwise cleared. Sprint, started_at,
  completed_at, cycle/lead time, epic, story, and parent_task_id are
  intentionally not copied — see the plan for the rationale.
- Activity log on both ends: `moved_to_project` on the source (carries
  new task's id/key and the chosen strategies in `activity_metadata`)
  and `created_from_move` on the new task (carries source's id/key).
- No schema migration — existing `task_dependencies` with
  `dependency_type="duplicates"` is the link mechanism.

### Frontend

- New shared `MoveToProjectModal` (`components/planning/MoveToProjectModal.tsx`)
  used by both single-task and bulk entry points. Project picker excludes
  the source project and any archived project. Subtask-strategy radio
  shows only on single-task moves when the task has subtasks.
- New `useTaskMove` hook (`hooks/useTaskMove.ts`) wrapping both the
  single and bulk mutations, with `invalidateTaskCaches` integration and
  friendly toast messages mapped from each stable error code.
- `EditTaskModal` sidebar (project board) gains a "Move to project…"
  button above "Archive Task".
- The board's multi-select bulk toolbar gains a "Move to Project"
  button next to the existing "Move to Sprint" dropdown.

### Tests

- 12 unit tests in `backend/tests/unit/test_task_move_to_project.py`:
  happy path, mark-done variant, cross-workspace reject, same-project
  reject, archived-source reject, subtask block / cascade / orphan,
  assignee membership rule, sprint+timing fields not copied,
  activity logged on both tasks, bulk-move continues on per-task
  failure.

## [0.8.33] - 2026-05-22

Follow-up sweep on the 0.8.32 status work — two production bugs and the
missing admin surface for editing categories themselves.

### Custom status slugs now round-trip through the API (bug fix)

`PATCH /teams/{id}/tasks/{id}` was rejecting any non-canonical slug
with a Pydantic `literal_error`:

```
Input should be 'backlog', 'todo', 'in_progress', 'review' or 'done'
```

Root cause: `TaskStatus` was still a `Literal[...]` at the schema
layer, defeating the whole point of project-scoped custom statuses
from 0.8.32. Two-part fix:

- `TaskStatus = str` in both `backend/src/aexy/schemas/sprint.py` and
  `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`. Any slug parses; validity is decided at
  write time, not parse time.
- New `SprintTaskService.validate_status_slug(task, slug)` checks the
  slug exists in the task's scope (`workspace_task_statuses` rows for
  the project OR workspace defaults). On miss → `400 unknown_status`.
  Wired into both `update_task` and `update_task_status`, on both
  PATCH endpoints (`/teams/.../tasks/...` and
  `/sprints/.../tasks/...`).

The canonical five seed slugs (`backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`,
`review`, `done`) are accepted unconditionally so workspaces that
pre-date the status table aren't bricked by tasks carrying slugs
without matching rows.

### Duplicate "On Hold" columns can no longer be created (bug fix)

Production was showing two columns titled `On Hold` on a kanban — the
admin had typed the name twice and `create_status` had silently
deduplicated only the *slug* (storing `on_hold` and `on_hold_1`).
Both rendered because the column title comes from `name`, not `slug`.

`create_status` and `update_status` now share an `_assert_name_unique`
helper that rejects case-insensitive name collisions within a scope
(workspace + project): error code `status_name_exists`, HTTP 400.

This prevents the future occurrence but does **not** clean up existing
duplicate rows in production data — admins need to delete one of the
duplicates via the new admin UI (below).

### Category admin UI on the per-project statuses page

`/settings/projects/{projectId}/statuses` gains a "Categories" section
above the existing statuses list:

- `CategoryModal` — create / edit a category with label, semantics
  (Open / Active / Done / Cancelled), and color. Slug is auto-derived
  from the label on create and locked on edit (existing statuses
  reference it as a string).
- `SortableCategoryItem` — compact row with color swatch, semantics
  badge, edit/delete menu.
- Delete is guarded both client-side (block if any status uses the
  category) and server-side (`category_in_use` error, HTTP 400).

### Tests

- `backend/tests/unit/test_task_status_validation.py` (new, 4 tests) —
  canonical slug accepted, project-scoped custom slug accepted,
  unknown slug rejected, slug scoped to a different project rejected.
- `backend/tests/unit/test_status_categories.py` (+1) —
  `test_create_status_rejects_duplicate_display_name` pins the
  case-insensitive name uniqueness check.

## [0.8.32] - 2026-05-22

Two threads landing together:

  1. **DB-driven status categories.** The `category` on each task status
     was previously locked to three Literal values (`todo`,
     `in_progress`, `done`). It's now a free-form slug validated
     against a new `workspace_status_categories` table that ships six
     canonical buckets per workspace (`backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`,
     `in_review`, `done`, `cancelled`) and is open to admin additions.
  2. **Project-scoped statuses actually reach the board.** The
     `useTaskStatuses(workspaceId, projectId)` hook + endpoint existed
     since 0.8.29, but both the project board (`sprints/[id]/board`)
     and the workspace All-Tasks tab were silently rendering hardcoded
     5-status arrays. They now call the hook and render whichever
     statuses the project (or workspace fallback) defines.
  3. **Board ↔ Table layout toggle.** The orphaned `Settings2` button
     in the board toolbar is replaced with a `LayoutGrid | Table2`
     pill; the workspace All-Tasks tab gains the same toggle. Layout
     is persisted per scope via the new `useTasksLayout` hook.

### Status categories from the database

- `backend/scripts/migrate_status_categories.sql` creates
  `workspace_status_categories` and seeds the six canonical buckets
  for every existing workspace. The unique index uses
  `COALESCE(project_id::text, '')` so workspace defaults and project
  overrides occupy separate uniqueness buckets, matching the pattern
  already in use for `workspace_task_statuses`.
- Each category carries a `semantics` field (one of `open`, `active`,
  `done`, `cancelled`). All business logic that needs to branch on
  completion (burndown, velocity) should read `semantics` — slugs
  are user-facing and renameable.
- `StatusCategory` in `backend/src/aexy/schemas/sprint.py` becomes
  `str`; `CategorySemantics` is the new `Literal`. The frontend
  mirror in `lib/api.ts` matches.
- New service helpers in `TaskConfigService`:
  `get_categories`, `get_categories_for_project`,
  `create_category`, `update_category`, `delete_category`,
  `reorder_categories`, `seed_default_categories`.
- New endpoints under `/workspaces/{id}/status-categories` with the
  same `?project_id=` scope filter as `/task-statuses`.
- `create_status` / `update_status` validate the category slug
  against the workspace's category set (with project fallback) and
  raise `TaskValidationError("unknown_category")` on miss.
  Workspaces created before the categories table existed get
  lazy-seeded on first write so legacy data never trips.

### Status modal, dynamic now

- `StatusModal` accepts a `categories` prop instead of a hardcoded
  array. Each cell renders the category color, label, and a small
  `semantics` chip; the title attribute carries the burndown hint.
  Both consumers (project statuses page + workspace task-config
  page) wire `useStatusCategories` and thread it through.

### Project-scoped statuses on the kanban

- `frontend/src/app/(app)/sprints/[projectId]/board/page.tsx` calls
  `useTaskStatuses(workspaceId, projectId)` and renders status
  columns from the resolved set (project rows or workspace
  fallback). The hardcoded five-column `STATUS_CONFIG` is kept only
  as a label/color fallback for the canonical slugs.
- `WorkspaceTasksTab.tsx` does the same when exactly one project is
  filtered in; otherwise it falls back to workspace defaults.
- `useProjectBoard.tasksByStatus` and
  `useWorkspaceTasks.tasksByStatus` are now `Record<string, _>`
  instead of `Record<TaskStatus, _>` so custom slugs bucket correctly.

### Board / Table view toggle

- `frontend/src/hooks/useTasksLayout.ts` — localStorage-backed
  `"board" | "table"` preference, scoped per surface
  (`board:<projectId>` for each project, `workspaceTasks` for the
  All-Tasks tab).
- `frontend/src/components/planning/TaskTableView.tsx` — shared
  dense table view used by both pages. Columns: Key, Title, Status
  (with the project-scoped color dot), Priority, Assignee, Sprint,
  Pts, Updated. Sticky header, hover row, bulk-select column,
  row-click opens the same detail surface as the kanban cards.
- The board page swaps its orphaned `Settings2` button for a
  segmented Board/Table pill; `WorkspaceTasksTab` adds the same
  pill in its toolbar alongside the existing project-statuses link.

### Tests

- New backend suite `tests/unit/test_status_categories.py` (7 tests)
  covers: canonical seed, fallback resolver, project override,
  unknown-category rejection on create + update, lazy-seed for
  legacy workspaces, and refusal to delete a category in use.
- New frontend Vitest specs:
  - `src/test/useTasksLayout.test.ts` — persistence, hydration,
    malformed-value guard, scope isolation.
  - `src/test/StatusModal.test.tsx` — dynamic categories rendering,
    submit payload uses the selected slug, empty-state hint.
- New Playwright spec `e2e/tasks-view-toggle.spec.ts` — a custom
  project status (`design_review`) surfaces as a kanban column on
  the board; the Board ↔ Table toggle swaps content and persists
  across reload via the scoped localStorage key.

### Migration notes

- The new SQL migration is idempotent and safe to re-run; it uses
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for the
  seed.
- Existing status rows keep their category strings unchanged. The
  migration also retags the seeded "Backlog" status from
  `category=todo` → `backlog` and "In Review" from `in_progress` →
  `in_review` for workspaces that hadn't renamed those rows.
- Pre-existing pre-existing pre-existing tests in
  `test_task_config_project_scope.py` continue to pass against the
  updated seed (it already used the `in_review` slug).

## [0.8.31] - 2026-05-22

Moves the status admin to its semantic home: project-scoped statuses
now live at `/settings/projects/<id>/statuses` next to General /
Permissions / Repositories, instead of the workspace settings page
with a `?project=` query param. The workspace task-config page keeps
its workspace-defaults mode; the project-scoped UI moves out.

### New project settings sub-route

- `frontend/src/app/(app)/settings/projects/[projectId]/statuses/page.tsx`
  hosts the project status admin in the same shell as General /
  Permissions: matching breadcrumb, project header chip, tab nav
  including the new `Statuses` link.
- Reuses `useTaskStatuses(workspaceId, projectId)`, the
  `DeleteStatusModal`, and the auto-fork backend from 0.8.29-0.8.30 —
  no new service or API.
- Fallback CTA ("Customize for this project") sits in the same
  position as the workspace settings page's version. Rows render
  read-only with a `Workspace default` chip until the fork happens.

### Shared status components

- Extracted `SortableStatusItem` to `frontend/src/components/settings/SortableStatusItem.tsx`
  — the row component used by both `task-config/page.tsx` and the
  new project statuses page. Includes the `readOnly` mode introduced
  in 0.8.30.
- Extracted `StatusModal` (the add/edit form) to
  `frontend/src/components/settings/StatusModal.tsx`. Both pages
  import it; the workspace page's inline copy is gone.

### Tab nav + deep-link re-aim

- Project settings (`/settings/projects/[projectId]` and `.../permissions`)
  pages grow a `Statuses` tab link. Repositories sub-page keeps its
  back-button layout untouched.
- `Columns` deep link on the project board
  (`/sprints/[projectId]/board`) now points at
  `/settings/projects/<id>/statuses` instead of
  `/settings/task-config?tab=statuses&project=<id>`.
- Same change on the workspace All-Tasks header — the link still
  only renders when the user has filtered to a single project.

### Notes

- `/settings/task-config` keeps its existing project picker for now;
  it still works but the project deep links no longer point at it.
  Once usage shifts to the new route the project-mode dropdown there
  can be retired.
- `useProject(workspaceId, projectId)` was already exporting
  `isLoading` — no hook changes needed for this PR.

## [0.8.30] - 2026-05-22

Finishes the project-scoped statuses UX: tasks no longer get orphaned
when a column is deleted; the project board has a direct entry point
into status editing; fallback projects render their inherited columns
as visually read-only; and adding a project status from fallback now
snapshots the workspace defaults first so the project doesn't lose
its inherited columns.

### Delete-with-migration (backend + UI)

- `TaskConfigService.delete_status(status_id, migrate_to_status_id=None)`
  now optionally rewrites every task pointing at the source status
  (`sprint_tasks.status_id` and the legacy `status` slug column) to
  the chosen target before the soft delete. Validation refuses a
  cross-workspace target, refuses a project-scoped target for a
  workspace-default delete (tasks come from across the workspace),
  refuses a different project's target for a project-scoped delete,
  and refuses self-target.
- New `GET /api/v1/workspaces/{ws}/task-statuses/{id}/usage` returns
  `{ count }` — powers the delete modal's "N tasks use this status"
  copy.
- `DELETE /api/v1/workspaces/{ws}/task-statuses/{id}` now accepts a
  `?migrate_to=<uuid>` query param.
- `frontend/src/components/settings/DeleteStatusModal.tsx` replaces
  the previous `confirm()` dialog. Renders the usage count, requires
  a target status when count > 0, defaults the target to a same-
  category sibling for sensible fallback, and surfaces the backend's
  stable error codes inline.

### Auto-snapshot on first project-scoped create

- `create_status(project_id=...)` for a project that's currently on
  fallback now clones the workspace defaults into that project before
  inserting the new row. Without this, the resolver would flip from
  "5 inherited statuses" to "1 manually-added status" the moment an
  admin clicked Add Status from a per-project view — silent column
  loss.

### Entry points from the project board

- `frontend/src/app/(app)/sprints/[projectId]/board/page.tsx` gets a
  "Columns" link in the toolbar (next to Add Task) that deep-links
  to `/settings/task-config?tab=statuses&project=<projectId>`.
- `frontend/src/components/planning/WorkspaceTasksTab.tsx` shows the
  same link in the All-Tasks header when filtered to a single project.
- `task-config/page.tsx` reads `?project=<uuid>` from the URL and
  preselects the scope dropdown so the deep links land where they
  promise.

### Read-only workspace-default preview

- `SortableStatusItem` gains a `readOnly` prop. When the page is in
  per-project mode and the project is in fallback (`isUsingWorkspaceFallback`),
  rows render with a `Workspace default` chip and the drag-handle /
  edit / delete affordances hide. The single primary action becomes
  the existing "Customize for this project" CTA.

### Tests

- 5 new unit tests in `test_task_config_project_scope.py`:
  - `count_tasks_using_status` returns the count.
  - `delete_status` with a target rewrites both `status_id` and the
    legacy `status` slug on every affected task.
  - `delete_status` without a target leaves tasks pointing at the
    now-inactive row (legacy slug still renders the card).
  - Cross-workspace / cross-project migration targets are rejected
    with `migration_target_other_workspace` / `migration_target_other_project`.
  - `create_status(project_id=...)` on a fallback project copies the
    workspace defaults in before adding.
- Test that previously asserted "creating one project status yields
  exactly one row" was updated to match the new auto-snapshot
  behavior; the invariant it now expresses is "the resolver returns
  project-scoped rows once any exist", which is what the codebase
  actually relies on.

## [0.8.29] - 2026-05-22

Project statuses are now genuinely isolated from workspace edits. The
0.8.28 release introduced project-scoped statuses with a workspace
fallback; this release closes the gap where a fallback project would
still see workspace renames, deletions, and reorders flow through.

### Lazy auto-fork on destructive workspace edits

- New `TaskConfigService._snapshot_fallback_projects(workspace_id)`
  finds every project in the workspace that has no project-scoped
  status row of its own and runs `clone_workspace_statuses_to_project`
  for each, capturing the current workspace defaults.
- `update_status` and `delete_status` now invoke the snapshot **before**
  applying the change when the target row is a workspace default
  (`project_id IS NULL`). Editing a project-scoped row is a no-op for
  the snapshot — those projects already own their statuses.
- `reorder_statuses` invokes the snapshot when any of the reordered
  IDs is a workspace default; reordering changes a project's visual
  workflow and counts as destructive for the same reason as a rename.
- `create_status` (workspace) is intentionally **not** wrapped — adding
  a new status is additive, so fallback projects pick it up via the
  resolver without being auto-forked into snowflakes.
- All snapshot writes share the API endpoint's transaction (`db.commit`
  is the last step in `update_task_status` / `delete_task_status` /
  `reorder_task_statuses`), so a partial failure rolls back cleanly.

### Tests

- 5 new unit tests in `test_task_config_project_scope.py`:
  - Workspace rename snapshots the fallback project (project keeps
    the old name).
  - Workspace add does **not** snapshot (project stays in fallback
    and resolves the new status via the workspace defaults).
  - Workspace delete snapshots the fallback project (project keeps
    the deleted status as an active project override).
  - Workspace reorder snapshots the fallback project (project keeps
    the original order).
  - Workspace edit with a mixed project set leaves the already-
    customized project untouched and only forks the fallback one.

### Notes for follow-up frontend work

This release is backend-only. The discoverability work proposed
alongside this (kanban-header drawer, `/sprints/[projectId]/settings/
statuses` route, delete-with-task-migration modal, read-only
"Workspace default" preview, "reset to workspace defaults" undo)
will land in a follow-up PR. Operators editing statuses today still
use `/settings/task-config` with the project picker.

## [0.8.28] - 2026-05-22

Workspace All-Tasks gains inline create, statuses become per-project
(with a workspace fallback), and the kanban picks up a round of
Linear-style polish. Backend tests now run against SQLite without
the previous `ARRAY`/`JSONB` schema-compile blocker.

### Inline task create on the workspace kanban

- `WorkspaceTasksTab` (`/sprints?tab=tasks`) was read-only. Adds a
  hover-only `+` button per column, a Trello-style dashed "+ New
  task" row at the bottom of every column (Enter to submit, Esc to
  cancel, refocus on success for rapid entry), and a global "+ Add
  task" button in the filter bar.
- New `AddWorkspaceTaskModal` (`components/planning/AddWorkspaceTaskModal.tsx`)
  — compact, keyboard-first form with Project, Sprint, Status,
  Priority, Assignee, Story points, dates, and Estimate. Status
  renders as a locked chip when the modal is opened from a column,
  so the new card lands in the column the user clicked.
- Backend: new `POST /api/v1/workspaces/{ws_id}/tasks` endpoint
  (`api/workspace_tasks.py`) backed by `SprintTaskService.add_workspace_task`.
  Resolves `team_id` from `project_teams`, validates that the sprint
  (if any) belongs to that team, and rejects a `status_id` that
  belongs to a different project (returns one of the stable error
  codes `project_has_no_team` / `sprint_not_in_project` /
  `status_belongs_to_other_project` so the frontend can branch on
  the detail string).
- Last-used project persists in `localStorage` so successive
  quick-adds land on the same project without re-picking.

### Project-scoped task statuses (with workspace fallback)

- New migration `migrate_project_task_statuses.sql`: adds a nullable
  `project_id UUID` column to `workspace_task_statuses` and replaces
  the workspace+slug unique constraint with a scoped expression
  index (`workspace_id, COALESCE(project_id, ''), slug`). Existing
  rows keep `project_id = NULL` and continue to act as workspace
  defaults; rows with `project_id` set are project overrides.
- `TaskConfigService.get_statuses_for_project(workspace_id, project_id)`
  returns the project's own status rows when any exist, falling
  back to workspace defaults otherwise. This is the single helper
  the column UI, task-create validation, and the status admin API
  all share.
- New `clone_workspace_statuses_to_project` service helper +
  `POST /workspaces/{ws}/projects/{p}/task-statuses/clone-from-workspace`
  endpoint — idempotent fork-the-defaults action that powers the
  new "Customize for this project" CTA on the Statuses settings
  page.
- Existing `GET /workspaces/{ws}/task-statuses` now accepts
  `?project_id=<uuid>`; `POST /task-statuses` accepts `project_id`
  in the body. Response schema gains a `project_id` field.
- Frontend `useTaskStatuses(workspaceId, projectId?)` switches
  scope, exposes `cloneFromWorkspace` and an
  `isUsingWorkspaceFallback` flag for the CTA.
- Settings page (`settings/task-config`) gets a project picker; in
  per-project mode and using fallback statuses, an info banner
  offers the one-click clone.

### Backfill script (manual, not auto-run)

- `backend/scripts/backfill_project_task_statuses.py` — operator CLI
  that clones workspace defaults into existing projects. Flags
  `--workspace-id`, `--project-id`, `--all`, `--dry-run`. Idempotent
  (skips projects that already have overrides). The non-`migrate*.sql`
  filename keeps it out of the migration runner so it only runs
  when invoked explicitly.

### Kanban UX polish

- Bulk-actions toolbar (floats from the bottom when 1+ cards are
  selected via shift-click / per-card checkbox): bulk "Move to…"
  status change plus Clear.
- URL-persisted filters: `?q=`, `?assignee=`, `?priority=`, `?team=`,
  `?sprint=` round-trip so refresh / back-button / link-sharing
  reproduces the view.
- Keyboard shortcuts: `n` opens the new-task modal; `/` focuses the
  search input.
- Sticky column headers with backdrop-blur so the column name and
  count stay visible while scrolling long lists.
- Loading skeleton swapped from a flat pulsing block to
  column-shaped placeholders with staggered card animation delays.
- Mobile kanban: columns stack vertically below `md` (full-width,
  no max-height) instead of forcing a horizontal scroll on phones.
- Critical empty-state fix: when a workspace had **zero tasks** the
  page rendered "No tasks found" and hid the columns — making the
  new inline quick-add unreachable. The full empty-state now only
  appears when filters are active and matched nothing.

### Test infrastructure fixes

- `core/database.py` registers SQLite dialect shims via
  `@compiles(... "sqlite")` for `ARRAY → JSON`, `JSONB → JSON`,
  `INET → VARCHAR(45)`. Models declared with PG-only types now
  compile under `sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:` so the test suite
  reaches the test bodies instead of failing in
  `Base.metadata.create_all()`. 401 previously-blocked tests now
  run; remaining failures are pre-existing fixture issues
  unrelated to this PR.
- Dropped `'::jsonb'` casts from four `server_default` literals in
  `models/dashboard.py` and `models/crm.py` so SQLite accepts the
  DDL. PostgreSQL still parses the bare `'[]'` / `'{}'` defaults
  into JSONB.
- Playwright fixture `setupTaskBoardMocks` now sets the
  `aexy_authed` presence cookie via `page.context().addCookies()`,
  preventing the middleware from bouncing every spec to `/` and on
  to `/onboarding`. Unblocks `task-card-drag`,
  `task-create-attachments`, `task-link-clickable`,
  `task-over-estimate`, `task-attachment-ai-tags`, and
  `task-overdue-badge` in addition to the two new
  `workspace-tasks-create` specs.

### New tests

- `backend/tests/unit/test_task_config_project_scope.py` — 5 unit
  tests covering fallback to workspace defaults, project override
  preference, no cross-workspace leak, clone copy fidelity, and
  clone idempotency.
- `backend/tests/integration/test_workspace_tasks_api.py` — 5 API
  tests covering the happy path, cross-project status rejection,
  project-without-team rejection, status-list fallback, and clone
  idempotency.
- `frontend/e2e/workspace-tasks-create.spec.ts` — Playwright spec
  exercising the inline quick-add row (asserts the wire shape:
  `title`, `project_id`, `status`) and the global "Add task" modal.

### Other

- Frontend `lib/api.ts`: new `workspaceTasksApi.create()`,
  `taskConfigApi.getStatuses({ projectId })`, and
  `taskConfigApi.cloneToProject()`.
- i18n keys: `addTask`, `newTaskPlaceholder`, refreshed
  `dropTasksHere` copy in both `en` and `hi`.

## [0.8.27] - 2026-05-22

Part B follow-ups: close the three loops Part B's commit message
flagged as "deferred". All three streams of AI-generated content
now route through the proposed-edits queue, the doc owner gets a
notification each time a proposal lands, and the stale-conflict
view exposes a Regenerate action to refresh against the current
base.

### Sync service writes proposals

- `DocumentSyncService.regenerate_document` and `process_queue` were
  referenced by the Temporal `regenerate_document` /
  `process_document_sync_queue` activities but didn't exist on the
  service — the whole sync regen path was dead. Implemented both,
  routing through `ProposedEditsService.create_proposal` with
  `source=code_change_sync`.
- `_trigger_real_time_sync` no longer marks the doc
  `pending_regeneration` and forgets about it — it generates fresh
  docs and creates a proposal via a new shared `_generate_and_propose`
  helper.

### suggest_improvements → queue

- New `POST /workspaces/{ws}/documents/{doc_id}/suggest-improvements/apply`.
  Takes a `suggestion_summary` query string (copy/pasted from the
  `improvements[].suggestion` field returned by the existing
  `suggest-improvements` endpoint), runs it through
  `DocumentGenerationService.update_documentation`, and lands the
  result as a pending proposal with `source=suggest_improvements`.
  The legacy GET-style `suggest-improvements` keeps its
  "return-suggestions-list" contract; the new endpoint is the
  "apply this one" action.

### Notifications on every new proposal

- `ProposedEditSource` lifecycle now fires a `DocumentNotification`
  to the document's `created_by_id` with the new `AI_PROPOSAL`
  type. Self-notifications (proposer == owner, e.g. owner-triggered
  manual regenerate) are suppressed. Best-effort: if the doc has no
  `created_by_id`, the notification step is a no-op (legacy fixture
  safety).
- New `DocumentNotificationType.AI_PROPOSAL` enum value
  (`backend/src/aexy/models/documentation.py`).

### Stale-conflict UX: Regenerate action

- `ProposedEditReview` gets a new optional `onRegenerate` prop. When
  the proposal is stale AND a handler is wired, the merge-conflict
  view renders a third action between Reject and "Apply anyway":
  Regenerate.
- `ProposedEditsBanner` wires this to a new `regenerate` mutation
  that calls `documentApi.generate(workspaceId, documentId)` — the
  new proposal supersedes the stale one server-side via
  `create_proposal`'s supersede sweep, so we just invalidate the
  query cache afterwards.
- Non-stale proposals never see the Regenerate button (test
  asserts this).

### Tests

- **Backend**: `test_proposed_edits_service.py` extended with
  `TestNotificationOnCreate` (3 specs): notification fired for
  owner, no self-notification, no notification when owner is
  missing.
- **Frontend**: `docs-proposed-edits.spec.ts` extended with two
  specs: stale conflict renders Regenerate + clicking it calls
  `POST /generate`; non-stale proposals don't show the button.
  Total docs E2E: 29 specs, ~60 s.

### Versions

Bumped both `backend/pyproject.toml` and `frontend/package.json`
to 0.8.27.

## [0.8.26] - 2026-05-22

Part B of the AI documentation initiative: the **proposed-edits
review queue**. AI-generated content no longer overwrites
`document.content` directly — it lands in a pending queue the user
approves or rejects through a banner above the editor.

### Data model

- **New table `document_proposed_edits`**
  (`backend/scripts/migrate_document_proposed_edits.sql`). Columns:
  `id, document_id, source, proposed_content (jsonb),
  base_content_sha, diff_summary (jsonb), status, proposed_by_id,
  proposed_at, reviewed_by_id, reviewed_at, reason`. Indexed on
  `(document_id, status)` for the banner's hot read path and on
  `(document_id, base_content_sha)` for stale-detection lookups.
- **`DocumentProposedEdit` SQLAlchemy model** in
  `aexy.models.documentation` + `ProposedEditSource` and
  `ProposedEditStatus` enums. Wired into `models/__init__.py`'s
  `__all__`.
- **Pydantic schemas** — `ProposedEditCreate`, `ProposedEditResponse`
  (carries computed `is_stale`), `ProposedEditReject`.

### Service

- **`ProposedEditsService`** (`backend/src/aexy/services/proposed_edits_service.py`)
  - `create_proposal` snapshots the current `content_sha` if the
    caller didn't supply one, then auto-supersedes prior pending
    proposals on the same document. The new row is flushed before
    the supersede UPDATE runs, so the new proposal's id can be
    referenced in the supersede `reason` without a null-id race.
  - `approve` routes through `DocumentService.update_document`
    which creates a `DocumentVersion` automatically — every approved
    proposal lands as a versioned change.
  - `reject` records an optional human-readable reason.
  - `is_stale` compares the proposal's `base_content_sha` against
    the document's current SHA; rows without a base are never
    flagged (legacy / migration safety).
  - `compute_content_sha` is key-order invariant (`sort_keys=True`)
    so JS round-trips that re-serialize equivalent content don't
    spuriously trigger the stale badge.

### API

- **`POST /workspaces/{ws}/documents/{doc_id}/generate`** default
  changed: now creates a pending `proposed_edit` instead of writing
  to `document.content`. Legacy overwrite behaviour is preserved
  behind `?apply=true` for scripted / migration callers.
- **`GET /workspaces/{ws}/documents/{doc_id}/proposed-edits`** —
  list pending (default), or `?status=approved|rejected|superseded|all`.
- **`POST .../proposed-edits/{id}/approve`** — applies and
  transitions; bumps the version chain via DocumentService.
- **`POST .../proposed-edits/{id}/reject`** — records reason.

### Frontend

- **`ProposedEditsBanner.tsx`** — banner above the editor when
  pending proposals exist. Groups by source (`regenerate`,
  `code_change_sync`, `suggest_improvements`, `manual_ai_edit`)
  with distinct icons/labels per group. Click a proposal to expand
  the review inline.
- **`ProposedEditReview.tsx`** — three diff modes:
  - **Summary (default)**: sections added / removed / headings
    changed, scannable, no scrolling.
  - **Unified**: full JSON view in a scroll container.
  - **Side-by-side**: current vs proposed columns.
  Approve / Reject actions live in the footer; Reject opens an
  inline reason input. When `proposal.is_stale` is true, the
  banner shows the merge-conflict UX and the Approve button copy
  flips to "Apply anyway".
- **Wired into `app/(app)/docs/[documentId]/page.tsx`** above the
  editor. The component self-hides when there are no pending
  proposals — no layout shift on docs that don't have AI edits.
- **`documentApi.{listProposedEdits, approveProposedEdit,
  rejectProposedEdit}`** added to `lib/api.ts` plus `ProposedEdit`,
  `ProposedEditSource`, `ProposedEditStatus` types.

### Tests

- **Backend**: `tests/unit/test_proposed_edits_service.py` — 10
  unit tests covering `compute_content_sha` invariants
  (deterministic, key-order invariant, None == {}), `create_proposal`
  (SHA snapshotting, flush-before-supersede ordering, string-source
  acceptance), and `is_stale` (no-base / matching / diverged).
- **Frontend**: `e2e/docs-proposed-edits.spec.ts` — 5 specs covering
  banner rendering, all three diff modes (summary / unified /
  side-by-side toggle), approve flow, reject-with-reason flow, and
  the stale conflict UX.

Full backend unit suite for docs: 10 specs pass.
Full docs E2E: 27 specs, ~58 s.

### Migration order

Run `python scripts/run_migrations.py` (the new
`migrate_document_proposed_edits.sql` is the only pending change).
No backfill needed — proposals only land going forward, legacy
generate callers that pass `?apply=true` keep working unchanged.

## [0.8.25] - 2026-05-22

Part A of the AI documentation testing initiative: TDD coverage for
autogenerate flows + the autoupdate plumbing. The audit had flagged
that the entire docs-AI surface had zero tests; this commit closes
that with 11 specs and surfaces three bugs along the way, two of
which are fixed in the same change.

Part B (`proposed_edits` model + approval UX) lands separately.

### Bugs caught + fixed

- **`PlanTier.TEAM` AttributeError in DocumentSyncService**
  (`backend/src/aexy/services/document_sync_service.py:68`).
  Line referenced `PlanTier.TEAM.value` but the enum has no `TEAM`
  member. Every free-tier or pro-tier-without-realtime developer
  hit AttributeError when `get_sync_type_for_developer` was called.
  Fixed to `PlanTier.ENTERPRISE.value`, matching the convention used
  in `api/knowledge_graph.py`, `api/notifications.py`,
  `api/app_access.py`. Caught by `test_document_sync_service.py`.
- **`suggest_improvements` schema drift** (multi-line fix).
  `DocumentGenerationService.suggest_improvements` claims to return
  `{quality_score, improvements[], missing_sections[],
  overall_assessment}` but was returning generic code-analysis JSON
  (`languages, frameworks, code_quality, summary`) because:
  1. `lmstudio_provider._build_analysis_prompts` had no branch for
     `AnalysisType.DOC_*` types — they fell through to
     `CODE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT`, dropping the service's custom prompt.
     Fixed by adding a DOC_* branch that honours
     `request.context["system_prompt"]` + uses the pre-formatted
     `request.content` verbatim.
  2. The service's `json.loads(result.raw_response)` blew up on
     markdown-fenced LLM output. Extracted `_parse_llm_json` helper
     that strips ```json fences before parsing. Applied to all four
     `raw_response` parse sites in the service.
  3. Tightened `DOC_IMPROVEMENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` to say "Respond ONLY
     with valid JSON … No preamble, no analysis, no markdown fences".
  4. Bumped `lmstudio_config` `max_tokens` in the AI test conftest
     from 2048 → 8192 so Qwen "thinking" models don't run out of
     budget before producing JSON.
  Caught by `test_suggest_improvements.py::test_returns_documented_contract_shape`.
- **Orphan `SyncStatusPanel`** (`frontend/src/components/docs/SyncStatusPanel.tsx`).
  221 LOC of pending-changes UI implemented but never mounted in
  any page. Wired into `app/(app)/docs/[documentId]/page.tsx`:
  uses `useDocumentCodeLinks` to compute the pending count, renders
  above the editor when the doc has any code links, exposes a
  manual-sync button that calls `documentApi.generate`. Caught while
  writing the FE pending-banner spec.

### Frontend dev container & test container

- Installed `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-cov`, `aiosqlite` into
  the `aexy-backend` image (they weren't there before, blocking any
  attempt to run the backend test suite via `docker exec`).

## [0.8.24] - 2026-05-22

Docs UI/UX follow-up sweep: the five items the 0.8.23 commit
deliberately left as "out of cluster scope" — visual gradient
heroes, ring-spinner duplication, Drive IA confusion, hardcoded
colour refs, mobile responsiveness on Drive/Files/Knowledge-Graph.
5 new E2E specs lock the changes in (18 total docs E2E specs now,
~32 s full pass).

### Visual: gradient heroes gone

- **Replaced the `from-primary-500/20 to-purple-500/20` rounded-2xl
  icon hero in two places** (`DocsLayoutClient.tsx`, `page.tsx`)
  with a typography-first treatment: small tracked eyebrow label,
  semibold tracking-tight headline, one line of supporting copy.
  The audit called this gradient pattern the strongest "AI-slop"
  tell in the surface — `docs-no-gradient-hero.spec.ts` regression-
  guards both heroes.
- Landing headline shifted from "Documentation / Create, organize,
  and auto-generate documentation from your code" to an inviting
  "What do you want to write today?" with shorter supporting copy.

### Spinner consolidation

- **New `components/ui/spinner.tsx`** with `xs|sm|md|lg` size variants,
  `role="status"`, `data-testid="aexy-spinner"`, and an sr-only
  label. Replaces four near-identical inline implementations:
  `DocsLayoutClient.tsx:81` (lg), `[documentId]/page.tsx:45` (md),
  `CollaborativeEditor.tsx:319` (sm), `TemplateSelector.tsx:140` (xs).
- Future docs/UI spinners should reuse this component; the old
  inline pattern accumulated four variants of the same idea across
  the surface.

### Drive IA: distinct from docs, discoverable from the sidebar

- **Sidebar gains a "Files" link** in `SidebarNavigation.tsx` pointing
  at `/docs/drive`. Drive was previously reachable only by URL.
- **Drive page heading renamed to "Files & Storage"** (`drive.page.title`
  in `messages/en/drive.json` + `messages/hi/drive.json`) with a new
  subtitle: "Workspace files, task attachments, and compliance
  documents — separate from your written docs." Makes the relationship
  to docs explicit.
- `docs-drive-ia.spec.ts` asserts the sidebar Files link is present,
  click lands on /docs/drive, and the renamed heading + subtitle
  render correctly.

### Colour tokens sweep

- **85 → 70 hardcoded colour refs in the docs surface.** Visible
  destructive/success states replaced with semantic tokens:
  `text-red-{300,400}` → `text-destructive`, `bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20`
  → `bg-destructive/10`, `text-emerald-400` (saved indicator) → `text-success`.
  Touched: `DocumentItem.tsx` (Delete menu item), `[documentId]/page.tsx`
  (error state), `CodeLinksDisplay.tsx`, `CodeLinkPanel.tsx`,
  `CreateSpaceModal.tsx`, `GenerationPanel.tsx` (error+success banners),
  `DocumentEditor.tsx` (Saved indicator). 15 refs collapsed.
- Remaining ~70 are mostly: `CollaborationAwareness.tsx` (dead code),
  `VersionHistoryPanel.tsx` (diff visualization where red specifically
  means "removed"), `SyncStatusPanel`/`GitHubSyncPanel` (domain-specific
  status palettes), and `DocumentItem.tsx`'s yellow favorite-star.

### Mobile sub-routes

- **Audit at 390×844** of `/docs/drive`, `/docs/files`, and
  `/docs/knowledge-graph`. All three render usable content on
  mobile after the Cluster 1 fixes (Drive already had `lg:flex-row`
  + `lg:w-56` responsive utilities; KnowledgeGraph paywall is
  naturally vertically-flowed; `/docs/files` redirects to `/docs/drive`).
- `docs-mobile-sub-routes.spec.ts` locks in the regression: each
  route's primary content is visible at 390 px and the CTAs/headings
  don't overflow the viewport.

### Tests

5 new E2E specs (`frontend/e2e/docs-*.spec.ts`):

- `docs-no-gradient-hero` — regression guard
- `docs-drive-ia` — sidebar link + renamed heading + subtitle
- `docs-mobile-sub-routes` — 3 routes × 390 px content reachability

Total docs E2E: 18 specs, ~32 s full pass.

## [0.8.23] - 2026-05-22

In-app docs UX bug-fix sweep across three clusters (shell, editor,
a11y), TDD against 13 new E2E specs. Captures every fix in a failing-
then-passing test so the regressions can't sneak back. Cmd+K now
actually searches docs, mobile is no longer unusable, the editor
gets a real reading measure plus bullets + a floating BubbleMenu,
and the sidebar exposes tree semantics to assistive tech.

### Cluster 1 — shell fixes

- **`Cmd+K` in `/docs` opens the doc-scoped SearchModal, not the
  global CommandPalette.** Two `keydown` listeners on `document` were
  racing — the app-shell global was mounted earlier and won. The docs
  layout now installs its listener in capture phase and calls
  `stopImmediatePropagation()`, so the global never sees the event
  on docs routes. (`DocsLayoutClient.tsx`)
- **Sidebar collapses to a drawer below `md`.** The hard-coded
  `w-60 flex-shrink-0` was eating ~62 % of a 390 px viewport. Sidebar
  now slides off-screen via `-translate-x-full md:translate-x-0`,
  with a `data-testid="docs-mobile-menu-trigger"` hamburger in a new
  mobile top bar (`pl-14` so it doesn't collide with the app-shell's
  fixed-position trigger) and a backdrop that closes on tap.
  Drawer auto-closes on route change.
- **Delete confirmation is a styled dialog, not `window.confirm()`.**
  `NotionSidebar.tsx` now opens the existing `ConfirmDialog` from
  `components/ui/confirm-dialog.tsx` with `tone="danger"` and a
  "Delete" primary action. The native browser dialog (which broke
  visual consistency with the dark theme) is gone.
- **Inert menu items hidden until implemented.** "Duplicate" and
  "Manage Space" were `console.log("…")` TODOs surfaced as live
  affordances. NotionSidebar no longer passes the `onDuplicate` /
  `onManageSpace` props, so DocumentItem's existing
  `{onDuplicate && (…)}` guards collapse the rows. Real handlers
  can be wired later without changing markup.
- **`/docs/files` no longer strands on "Loading document…".**
  The bare prefix matched the `[documentId]` catch-all with
  `documentId="files"` and loaded forever. A new
  `app/(app)/docs/files/page.tsx` redirects to `/docs/drive`.

### Cluster 2 — editor fixes

- **Reading-measure cap.** `prose ... max-w-none` (which ran ~140
  cpl on 1440 px viewports) replaced with
  `prose ... max-w-3xl mx-auto` (~672 px / ~65 cpl). Editor
  spec asserts `≤ 900 px` at 1440 desktop.
  (`DocumentEditor.tsx:181`)
- **Lists render visible markers again.** Tailwind's preflight
  reset was stripping bullets off bare `<ul>`/`<ol>` inside the
  ProseMirror because typography-plugin `prose-ul:` modifiers
  weren't resolving in the cascade. Switched to arbitrary-variant
  utilities (`[&_ul]:list-disc [&_ul]:pl-6 [&_ol]:list-decimal
  [&_ol]:pl-6 [&_li]:my-1`) which carry enough specificity.
- **Emoji picker closes on Escape.** Audit caught the picker
  staying open across three intermediate actions. Added a
  scoped `keydown` listener while the picker is mounted; on
  Escape it sets `showEmojiPicker(false)`.
- **Manual `Save` button removed.** `autoSave` is on by default
  with a 1 s debounce; the duplicate Save button created
  "is autosave actually working?" doubt. Drop the `onSave` prop
  passed to EditorToolbar — the `{onSave && (…)}` guard already
  collapses the row. `handleManualSave` callback also removed.
- **Floating BubbleMenu is back in the non-collab path.** The
  BubbleMenu only existed in `CollaborativeEditor.tsx`, which is
  hard-disabled by `collaborationEnabled = false`. DocumentEditor
  now mounts its own BubbleMenu with Bold/Italic/Underline/Code
  controls. `data-testid="docs-bubble-menu"` lives on an inner
  wrapper because `@tiptap/react@2.27.1` BubbleMenu only forwards
  `className` to the rendered div (verified by reading
  `node_modules/@tiptap/react/dist/index.cjs`).

### Cluster 3 — ARIA / accessibility

- **SearchModal exposes the right contract.** `role="dialog"` +
  `aria-modal="true"` + `aria-label="Search documents"` on the
  modal root. Screen-reader users can now identify the overlay.
- **Sidebar is a real tree.** The scrollable content container
  gets `role="tree"` + `aria-label="Documents"`. Each
  DocumentItem row gets `role="treeitem"` + `aria-selected`
  (driven by `isSelected`) + `aria-expanded` when it has children.
  Active document is `aria-selected="true"`.

### Tests

13 new E2E specs under `frontend/e2e/docs-*.spec.ts`, all live-
backend, no LLM (use `backendOnlyReady` + `setupAiLiveAuth`).
Spec-first per cluster: write specs → run them red → implement
fixes → run them green. Files:

- `docs-cmdk-doc-search`, `docs-mobile-sidebar` (×2),
  `docs-styled-confirm-dialog`, `docs-todo-menu-items-hidden`,
  `docs-files-route-redirect`
- `docs-editor-reading-measure`, `docs-editor-list-bullets`,
  `docs-editor-emoji-picker-escape`, `docs-editor-no-save-button`,
  `docs-editor-bubble-menu`
- `docs-a11y-search-modal`, `docs-a11y-doc-tree`

Full suite passes in ~22 s.

## [0.8.22] - 2026-05-22

AI/automation E2E coverage expansion: the workflow builder now has a
schema-driven test fixture, 35 new Playwright specs across nodes,
triggers, actions, templates and end-to-end runs, plus tighter
assertions on the live-LLM tests so the suite actually catches
provider drift and prompt regressions instead of greenlighting them.

### Workflow builder — new `join` node + canvas testability

- **`join` is now a first-class node type.** Added to
  `WorkflowNodeType` in `backend/src/aexy/schemas/workflow.py`; the
  canvas's `JoinNode` was already wired up but the schema literal
  was missing, so `nodes: [..., { type: "join" }]` round-trips
  through validation now instead of being silently coerced.
- **`NodePalette` and `NodeConfigPanel` got stable test hooks.**
  `data-testid="palette-category-${kind}"`,
  `palette-subtype-${kind}-${value}` on every entry, plus
  `data-testid="node-config-panel"` + `role="dialog"` on the config
  drawer. One helper change updates every spec instead of 200.
- **Categories without subtypes show a hover-revealed `+` affordance.**
  A bare row gave no visual hint that clicking does anything;
  drag-first UX stays primary, the icon is subtle by design.

### Automation templates — save no longer silently 400s

- **`send_email` template actions now ship subject + body.** The
  backend's `validate_workflow` rejects email actions without
  `email_body`, so the "follow-up sequence" and "welcome sequence"
  templates were silently failing the save with HTTP 400 and the
  user saw an empty canvas after "saving" (`automationTemplates.ts`).
- **Template action `config` is spread flat into node `data`.**
  `NodeConfigPanel` writes action fields flat (`data.email_body`,
  `data.duration_value`) and the backend reads them flat too;
  nesting under `data.config` meant the validator never saw the
  required fields. No remaining `node.data.config.*` readers
  anywhere in the frontend.

### Schema-driven test fixture

- **`backend/scripts/dump_automation_schema.py`** emits the
  trigger/action registry to
  `frontend/e2e/fixtures/automation-schema.generated.json`. The
  per-subtype specs (`ai-automation-triggers-*`,
  `ai-automation-actions-*`) parametrise from this fixture so
  adding a new trigger on the backend forces a matching test entry.
- **`npm run schema:automation`** regenerates the fixture via
  `docker exec aexy-backend ...`. **`npm run schema:automation:check`**
  is the CI drift gate. Both now precheck that `aexy-backend` is
  running and exit with a clear message ("Start it with:
  docker-compose up -d backend") instead of leaving devs to parse
  a raw `docker exec` error.

### AI automation E2E suite — 35 new specs

- **Three layers, all live-backend:**
  1. **Per-node CRUD** (`ai-automation-node-{trigger,action,
     condition,wait,agent,branch,join}.spec.ts`) — palette add,
     config-panel render, click-to-select, delete.
  2. **Per-subtype parametrised loops** —
     `ai-automation-{triggers,actions}-{module}.spec.ts` covering
     every trigger and action in every module's registry, all
     driven by the generated fixture above.
  3. **End-to-end** — `canvas-wire` (6-node save/reload
     round-trip), `templates` (every gallery template lands a
     usable graph), `generate-workflow-per-module` (LLM generator
     across all 10 modules), `run-agent` and `end-to-end`
     (record-created trigger → seeded LLM agent → workspace
     state mutation, with marker-envelope assertions).
- **Shared helpers in `frontend/e2e/fixtures/automation-helpers.ts`**
  — `openCanvas`, `addNodeFromPalette`, `canvasNodes`,
  `openNodeConfig`, `connectNodes`, `saveWorkflow`,
  `fetchWorkflow`, `deleteAutomation`. Roughly 35 specs share one
  contract; testid drift breaks one helper, not the whole suite.

### Live-LLM assertions — false-positive class eliminated

- **Marker-envelope check on agent output.** `ai-automation-run-agent`
  and `ai-automation-end-to-end` now pass a per-test
  `echo_token` in `trigger_data` and instruct the agent (via its
  system prompt) to wrap it in a literal `[ECHO:<token>]`
  envelope. The envelope shape can't appear from stub providers,
  cached responses, or a passthrough copy of input data — only
  from an LLM that actually read and reshaped the payload.
- **`generate-workflow-per-module` now hard-fails on unknown
  `trigger_type`.** A `console.warn` previously demoted LLM
  hallucinations like `record.modified` (instead of
  `record.updated`) to log noise nobody reads — exactly the
  prompt-regression class this spec exists to catch. Now an
  unknown trigger fails the test with the known-trigger list in
  the failure message.
- **`run-agent` workflow status check tightened from
  `["completed", "running", "failed"]` to strictly `"completed"`.**
  `dry_run=true` is synchronous so anything else means the
  executor bailed before producing the node_results we go on to
  assert against.

### Test-env plumbing

- **`backendOnlyReady` (in `frontend/e2e/fixtures/ai-env.ts`)**
  splits the LM Studio probe out of `aiLiveReady`. Structural
  tests that don't invoke any LLM (canvas wiring, palette
  interaction, save round-trip) no longer skip the entire spec
  file when LM Studio happens to be down.
- **`setupAiLiveAuth` now sets the `aexy_authed=1` cookie before
  the first navigation.** Middleware redirects every protected
  route to `/?next=...` when the cookie is missing — and the
  cookie is normally set client-side by `useAuth` AFTER mount, so
  without this fix the very first goto bounced through the login
  page and dropped any query params we'd set.
- **`playwright.config.ts`** honours `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` instead
  of hard-coding `http://localhost:3000`, so the suite can run
  against a non-default host (CI runner, remote box).
- **`docker-compose.yml`** passes
  `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL=${LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL:-http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1}`
  into the backend. `localhost` inside the container was the
  container, not the host — the agent action couldn't reach the
  developer's LM Studio during E2E and dev runs.

## [0.8.21] - 2026-05-22

AI surface hardening: the `/automations` canvas no longer crashes on
LLM-generated workflows, the agent provider list catches up with the
backend, the frontend dev container has the headroom to run the new
live AI E2E suite, and a small layout bug in the workflow generator
is fixed before it ships.

### Workflow generator — layout fix

- **LLM-generated workflows now render reliably.** The
  `POST /automations/generate-workflow` response had no `position`
  on its nodes, so ReactFlow crashed the `/automations` canvas and
  bounced the user to the route's error boundary. Backend now
  assigns `{x, y}` to every generated node via a one-shot
  auto-layout pass before responding
  (`backend/src/aexy/services/workflow_generator.py`).
- **Layout uses longest-path topological depth.** Diamonds and
  fan-in graphs (`A→B→C→D` plus `A→D`) now place the merge node at
  the depth of the longer path, with descendants cascading correctly.
  The earlier BFS variant settled the merge node at the shallower
  depth if the short edge was walked first. Five new unit tests in
  `tests/unit/test_workflow_generator.py` pin the contract: every
  node gets a position, linear chains cascade right, the diamond
  case settles on longest-path depth, existing positions are
  preserved, and cycles render rather than crash.

### Agent LLM provider list — FE/BE parity

- **DeepSeek and LM Studio show up in the provider picker.** The
  backend has accepted `"deepseek"` and `"lmstudio"` as
  `AgentCreate.llm_provider` values for a while; the frontend
  selector only knew the four originals, so any agent created with
  one of the new providers crashed the agent detail page when
  `LLMConfigDisplay` tried `PROVIDERS[provider].models.find(...)`.
  Selector now lists DeepSeek (Chat + Reasoner) and LM Studio
  (Qwen 3.5 9B), and `LLMConfigDisplay` falls back to a generic
  render for any future unknown provider rather than throwing.
  (`frontend/src/components/agents/shared/LLMProviderSelector.tsx`)

### Frontend dev container — heap headroom

- **No more silent OOM kills during AI E2E runs.** Turbopack's
  lazy compilation across `/agents`, `/automations`, `/chat`,
  `/compliance`, … in quick succession was exhausting the default
  Node heap and getting SIGKILL'd by Docker. Frontend service now
  sets `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=6144` (6 GiB V8 heap)
  with a matching `mem_limit: 7g` so Docker doesn't kill the
  process before V8 has a chance to GC (`docker-compose.yml`).

### AI E2E test suite — new live tier

- **15 new `frontend/e2e/ai-*.spec.ts` specs** drive every AI
  surface (agent chat + conversation create + prompt preview +
  test run, /ask, workflow generation, automation test run, code
  analysis, developer insights, email draft, file
  metadata/sidecar, file search, hiring re-evaluate, learning
  path, review-cycle generate) against the **live** stack — real
  frontend, real backend, real LM Studio. Mocked AI responses
  defeat the point of this tier; the existing `*.spec.ts` files
  cover UI-only behaviour.
- Auto-skips the whole file when LM Studio is unreachable, exactly
  like the backend `tests/ai/` suite.
- Shared helpers in `frontend/e2e/fixtures/ai-env.ts` (env +
  LM Studio probe + auth bootstrap) and
  `frontend/e2e/fixtures/ai-helpers.ts` (seeders, long-timeout
  response waiters, fatal-error collectors).
- Default LLM wait per request is 3 minutes (`AI_E2E_LLM_WAIT_MS`).
  A spec that times out is signalling that the model is genuinely
  slow, not flaky — don't lower it. See the new
  "AI E2E tests" section in `CLAUDE.md` for setup.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-05-21

`/reviews` surface UX overhaul, prod-bug fixes, and a tighter
contract between the frontend and the manager-review backend. One
hard 422 (manager Save Draft) is fixed via a backend schema relax
+ matching client change; the rest is i18n parity, draft-hydration
correctness, and accessibility nits.

### Reviews — bug fixes

- **Manager Save Draft no longer 422s.** The frontend used to send
  `overall_rating: 0` as a sentinel against `ManagerReviewSubmission`
  which is `Field(ge=1, le=5)` — every draft save before the manager
  had settled on a rating was rejected. `overall_rating` is now
  `Optional[float]` on the submission schema (the hard constraint
  stays on `FinalReviewData` where it actually matters), the service
  preserves any prior rating when `None` is passed, and the client
  drops the `?? 0` fallback. Three new regression tests pin the
  contract: null accepted, missing accepted, finalize still rejects
  out of range (`backend/tests/unit/test_reviews_prod_bugs.py`).
- **Discarded suggestions no longer leak across workspaces.** The
  hydration `useEffect` on `/reviews/manage` only wrote
  `discardedIds` when the new workspace key had data; switching to a
  workspace with no entry kept the previous team's discard list in
  state. Now always resets (`manage/page.tsx`).
- **Draft hydration re-runs on id change.** All three draft surfaces
  — manager review composer, self-review form, peer decline reason —
  used a boolean `hydratedRef` that stayed `true` across client-side
  nav, so visiting a second review/request id never hydrated its
  draft. Now keyed by id (`hydratedKeyRef === currentKey`), with an
  explicit reset when the new id has no stored draft.

### Reviews — UX consistency

- **Cycle list now shares the inline-error pattern.** Activate /
  advance on `/reviews/cycles` used to surface failures as a toast
  that sat hidden behind the open `ConfirmDialog`; the detail page
  rendered an inline red block inside the dialog. The list page now
  uses the same inline block — same place users see the failure
  matches the action that produced it.

### i18n — parity + sweep

- **25 new translation keys**, mirrored across `en` and `hi` (parity
  preserved at 550 keys each). Sweep covers: cycles list ConfirmDialog
  + toasts + status filter + breadcrumb + error panel; goal complete
  dialog; manage status filter; manage detail "Back to Reviews" +
  "Invite Peer Reviewers"; peer-requests error title.
- Hindi entries keep technical terms (PR, GitHub, peer reviewer,
  cycle, etc.) in English per the project convention.

### Accessibility

- **Notify dropdown trigger** on `/reviews/cycles/[cycleId]` now has
  an explicit `aria-label` alongside `title=` — screen readers don't
  reliably announce `title`, and the trigger needed a stable
  accessible name.

### Internal

- `next-env.d.ts` and `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` are now gitignored —
  the former is rewritten by Next between dev (`.next/dev/...`) and
  prod (`.next/...`) builds, the latter is per-machine.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-20

UX overhaul of the agents + automations surface, plus a four-week
accessibility sweep across the workspace shell. Nineteen commits since
`0.8.01` consolidate three workstreams: a unified Operations IA, an
inbox triage rewrite, and a long polish tail that migrates the last raw
modals/drawers off ad-hoc divs onto Radix `Dialog` / `Sheet` primitives.
Closes with four follow-ups from the PR #148 review.

### Operations IA + agents UX

- **Unified Operations page** (`/operations`, new). Single entry for
  agents *and* automations — replaces the two separate `/agents` and
  `/automations` landings, which the audit flagged as the #1 user
  confusion ("am I building an agent, or wiring a workflow?"). New
  `frontend/src/app/(app)/operations/page.tsx` (534 lines) plus
  sidebar layout updates and `messages/{en,hi}/operations.json`
  translations.
- **Agent inbox triage v2** (`/agents/[id]/inbox`). Multi-select with
  shift-click range, bulk-action toolbar (approve / dismiss / mark
  read), and full keyboard navigation (j/k row movement,
  x = toggle-select, enter = open). Inbox detail polish adds five
  follow-up wins (HTML email rendering via DOMPurify, sender chip,
  read-state indicator, optimistic toggles, skeleton during refetch).
- **Per-tab dirty state on the edit page** (`/agents/[id]/edit`).
  Replaces the prior single `hasChanges` boolean — each of the seven
  tabs (General / LLM / Tools / Behavior / Prompts / Escalation /
  Email) reports its own dirty bit so users switching tabs see which
  sections still have pending edits. Help text and the
  system-agent-locks-non-LLM-tabs disable are part of the same pass.
- **`useRouteGuard` hook** (`frontend/src/hooks/useRouteGuard.ts`,
  new). Anchor-click intercept + `beforeunload` for unsaved-changes
  prompting; companion `requestConfirm(href)` API for programmatic
  navigations (toolbar shortcuts, form-success redirects). Wired into
  the edit page; ready for reuse on automation builder and CRM detail
  forms.
- **Live-streamed executions + inbox**. React Query polling on the
  agent detail page so executions and inbox counts refresh without a
  manual reload. Pauses on hidden tabs (default RQ behavior); no extra
  socket plumbing.
- **Automation builder onboarding via template gallery**. New
  `frontend/src/components/automations/TemplateGallery.tsx` and
  `frontend/src/lib/automationTemplates.ts` — the automation `/new`
  page now opens to a curated gallery (standup digest, blocker
  escalation, sprint kickoff, etc.) instead of a blank canvas.

### Accessibility + polish (Weeks 1–4)

- **Modal/drawer primitives**. Migrated the last raw `<div role="dialog">`
  surfaces (delete-agent confirm, email-disable confirm, multi-select
  bulk confirm, automation-version pick) to `components/ui/dialog.tsx`
  (Radix `DialogPrimitive` — focus trap, escape, restored focus on
  close). Drawers (workflow Test Results, Execution History, Version
  History) moved to `components/ui/sheet.tsx`. New
  `components/ui/confirm-dialog.tsx` for the destructive-action pattern.
- **Chat surfaces**. Markdown rendering in `MessageBubble` with safe
  link handling, `aria-live="polite"` execution-status region in
  workflow nodes, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected on the chat
  thinking-indicator and the workflow canvas pan/zoom transitions.
- **Light-theme contrast + focus-visible**. ARIA labels on every
  icon-only button across agents/automations/inbox; `focus-visible`
  outlines added to all interactive surfaces; light-theme contrast
  bumps on placeholder text and disabled-state buttons.
- **Optimistic toggles + inbox skeleton**. Enable/disable agent + mark-
  read/unread now flip instantly with rollback on error; inbox shows
  skeleton rows during the first fetch instead of an empty state.
- **`lib/datetime.ts`**. Centralized relative-time + locale-aware
  date helpers; replaced ~20 ad-hoc `Intl.DateTimeFormat` callsites.
- **ICU plurals on counters**. "1 task" / "N tasks" etc. now driven by
  `next-intl` ICU patterns so the Hindi locale gets correct plural
  forms without per-callsite branching.
- **`messages/{en,hi}` additions** — `automations`, `inbox`,
  `insights`, `operations` namespaces (full parity between locales).

### Frontend

- **Per-tab dirty indicators on `agents/[id]/edit/page.tsx`**. Each
  tab carries its own `dirtyByTab[id]` so the tab strip can dot-mark
  which sections have unsaved edits. Form-init effect skips re-sync
  when the user has local changes (UX-EDT-021) — a refetch from
  background polling or another mutation won't clobber in-flight
  typing.
- **`auth/callback/page.tsx` + `lib/oauth.ts`**. Refactored the OAuth
  inflight tagging into a shared `OAuthInflightTagger` component;
  callback page no longer touches localStorage directly.

### Review followups (PR #148)

- **`middleware.ts`** — `AUTH_REQUIRED_PREFIXES` matched `/docs/` but
  not bare `/docs`, leaving the docs root unprotected by the auth
  gate. Now matches both, consistent with every other entry in the
  list.
- **`api/app_access.py`** — extracted `_load_template_for_workspace`
  helper. `update_member_access` and `apply_template_to_member` had
  inlined the identical "template belongs to this workspace (or is a
  system template)" check; both now call the helper.
- **`useRouteGuard.ts`** — wrapped `new URL(anchor.href, ...)` in
  try/catch. A page with a malformed anchor href would have thrown
  inside the captured click handler.
- **`agents/[id]/edit/page.tsx`** — added a rationale comment next to
  the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` suppression: `hasChanges` and
  `name` are read inside the form-init effect but intentionally
  excluded from deps to avoid re-syncing the form mid-edit.

### Streaming chat + agent runtime

- **SSE streaming on the agent chat surface** (`/agents/[id]/chat/...`).
  New `AgentService.stream_message` emits tokens, tool-call markers,
  and citations as Server-Sent Events; the frontend `useAgentChatStream`
  hook wires them into the message bubble incrementally with an
  optimistic placeholder, mid-stream stop, and a token-cost meter.
  Migration `migrate_agent_message_streaming.sql` adds the supporting
  columns on `agent_messages` (stream state, token deltas, citations).
- **`agents/base.py` + `services/agent_service.py`** — the agent base
  class gained a `stream()` co-routine alongside the existing
  request/response shape; the service routes streaming-capable agents
  through it and falls back to a single-shot completion for the rest.
- **MessageBubble citations**. Inline numbered footnotes link back to
  the cited tool-call output; renders even after the stream completes.

### Inbox thread chain + generate-from-prompt

- **Inbox thread chain**. Inbox replies are now stitched together via
  `parent_message_id`, so the detail pane renders the full back-and-
  forth (incoming → agent reply → reply-to-reply, etc.) instead of a
  flat list. New `test_inbox_thread_chain.py` (316 lines) pins the
  resolver against forked threads and missing parents.
- **Generate workflow from prompt**. The automation `/new` page can
  now seed a workflow from a natural-language description. New
  `services/workflow_generator.py` calls the LLM, validates the
  produced node graph, and hands it to the existing builder. Wired
  into `TemplateGallery` as a "Describe your workflow" entry.
- **Inbox unarchive** + Postmark parser fix in `api/email_webhooks.py`
  (Postmark's `MessageStream` field was being dropped on rebound
  events, breaking attribution for unarchived items).

### Agent edit + wizard

- **Defaults endpoint** (`GET /agents/defaults`) returns the system
  prompt / tools / behavior defaults for a given agent type so the
  wizard and edit page render preview state without hardcoding.
  Backed by `useAgentDefaults` on the frontend.
- **Prompt preview** on the edit page — substitutes a sample
  `{{variable}}` payload through the system prompt and renders the
  result inline so users see what the agent will actually see at
  runtime.
- **Server-side wizard drafts** (UX-DEF-003). New `agent_drafts` table
  (`migrate_agent_drafts.sql`), `AgentDraftService`,
  `GET/PUT/DELETE /agents/drafts` endpoints, and the `useAgentDraft`
  hook. Replaces the localStorage-only draft that vanished on
  cross-device switches; drafts auto-restore on wizard re-entry and
  garbage-collect on completion.

### Frontend reliability

- **`lib/reportError.ts`**. Centralized error reporter — forwards to
  Sentry when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is set, falls back to a
  structured console log otherwise. `ModuleError.tsx` boundary now
  reports through it instead of swallowing. 156-line test suite covers
  both branches.
- **Misc UX-close batch**: status counts on inbox tabs, accessible
  Save button (`aria-busy` during inflight, error-region announcement
  on failure), email-cancel resets the form to persisted values
  instead of leaving stale local edits, NodeConfigPanel layout fix.

### Tests

- **~120 new vitest + pytest cases** across:
  - `reportError.test.ts` (156 lines) — Sentry / console branches.
  - `useAgentDraft.test.tsx` (326 lines), `useAgentChatStream.test.tsx`
    (430 lines) — hook lifecycle, abort, error paths.
  - `test_agent_stream_message.py` (510 lines) — five SSE flows
    including mid-stream cancellation and tool-call interleaving.
  - `test_agent_draft_service.py` (226 lines) — CRUD + workspace-
    scope assertions.
  - `test_workflow_generator.py` (233 lines) — graph validation +
    LLM error fallback.
  - `test_agent_cost_estimation.py` (125 lines), `test_agent_preview_prompt.py`
    (340 lines), `test_inbox_thread_chain.py` (316 lines),
    `test_inbox_unarchive.py` (193 lines),
    `test_email_webhook_parse.py` (117 lines).

### Review followups (agents-big-features)

Post-merge audit of the streaming-chat + agent-runtime branch surfaced
one Critical cross-workspace gap on the new SSE endpoint plus a
cluster of Highs around partial state, citation XSS, and an SSE chunk-
buffering blind spot. Fixed in place; tests added for each.

- **Security (Critical):** `POST /workspaces/{ws}/crm/agents/{aid}/
  conversations/{cid}/messages/stream` now calls
  `_assert_agent_in_workspace` and rejects conversations whose
  `workspace_id` doesn't match the URL. Previously the endpoint only
  checked `conversation.agent_id == agent_id`, so a developer in
  workspace A who knew a foreign workspace's (agent_id, conversation_id)
  pair could stream user messages into that foreign conversation.
- **Backend:** SSE stream commits the user message + execution shell
  in a single transaction so a flush failure can't strand a user
  message without a paired execution row. Inbox thread forward walk
  now queries only the new frontier per round (was O(n²) on long
  threads); capped at 50 rounds matching the backward walk. Workflow
  generator caps generated graphs at 100 nodes / 200 edges so a runaway
  LLM response can't spawn thousands of canvas nodes.
- **AgentDraft persistence:** `save_draft` now uses
  `attributes.flag_modified(...)` to force the JSONB UPDATE (previously
  relied on assigning a new dict, which worked but was fragile under
  in-place mutation). Documented the pattern on the model field.
- **Frontend (chat surface):** Citations + markdown anchors now drop
  back to plain text for non-`http(s)` schemes, blocking
  `javascript:` / `data:` URL XSS at the source. Live token meter +
  per-message meter + "Sources" + "Processing…" + generate-prompt
  placeholder all flow through `useTranslations` (`messages/en/agents.json`,
  `messages/hi/agents.json`, `messages/{en,hi}/automations.json`). Per-
  message meter stacks under the timestamp on narrow screens. Optimistic
  message ids use `crypto.randomUUID()` instead of `Date.now()` so two
  sends in the same millisecond can't collide React keys.
- **Frontend (state hardening):** `useAgentChatStream` awaits
  `refetchQueries` then clears pending in the same tick (was
  `invalidateQueries` + 80 ms setTimeout, which caused a one-paint
  flicker when the refetch resolved fast). `useAgentDraft` tracks a
  save-sequence + mountedRef so a slow in-flight save can't overwrite
  newer state and unmount races don't trigger React's "set state on
  unmounted component" warning. Inbox thread strip drives selection
  through a state callback instead of `document.querySelector(...).click()`.
- **Tests:** Added gpt-4o vs gpt-4o-mini and dated-pin regression
  cases to `test_agent_cost_estimation.py` (the longest-prefix-wins
  sort would silently bill the wrong rate if reversed). Added a
  `useAgentChatStream` test that tears a frame across two stream
  chunks (mid-JSON + across `\n\n`) to lock in the buffer-reassembly
  behavior. 77 backend + 82 frontend tests passing.

## [0.8.01] - 2026-05-19

Post-review hardening of the 0.8.0 workspace-scope authz pass. Four
parallel reviewers audited the branch and flagged five Criticals plus
several Mediums that were missed in the original sweep; this release
closes all of them.

### Security (Critical)

- **`api/sprint_tasks.py` — bulk task ops 500'd on the new authz path**.
  `_filter_task_ids_to_workspace` ended with a stray `return sprint`
  (undefined name), so `bulk_assign_tasks`, `bulk_update_status`, and
  `bulk_move_tasks` raised `NameError` for every in-workspace call
  instead of authorizing them. Removed the dead return.
- **`api/reviews.py` — submit/finalize routes missed caller-identity
  checks**. `submit_self_review`, `submit_manager_review`, and
  `finalize_review` accepted any authenticated caller. Added
  `_require_reviewee` (caller must equal `review.developer_id`) and
  `_require_review_manager_or_admin` (caller must equal
  `review.manager_id` or hold workspace `admin`); both return 404 to
  avoid existence oracles.
- **`api/dependencies.py` — story/task dependency mutations had no
  workspace scope**. `update_story_dependency`, `delete_story_dependency`,
  `resolve_story_dependency` and the three task-dependency twins
  loaded by id with `db.get()` and mutated without any tenancy check.
  Added `_load_story_dependency_authorized` and
  `_load_task_dependency_authorized` helpers that resolve the
  dependent resource's workspace, assert active membership, and 404
  on mismatch. Wired into all six routes.
- **`api/email_webhooks.py` — SES SNS Notification path skipped
  signature verification** (WS-082). Only the `TopicArn` was checked
  against the allowlist; the field is attacker-controlled in the body,
  so anyone who knew or guessed an allow-listed ARN could POST forged
  Bounce/Complaint events. Added `verify_sns_message_signature` that
  builds the canonical AWS SNS string-to-sign, validates
  `SigningCertURL` against the AWS SNS host pattern (no SSRF), fetches
  the cert (cached by URL), and RSA-verifies the message envelope.
  Supports SignatureVersion 1 (SHA-1) and 2 (SHA-256).
- **`services/email_webhook_verify.py` — no replay window on SendGrid /
  Mailgun verifiers** (WS-082). A captured signed payload could be
  replayed indefinitely. Added a 300s skew check on both providers,
  matching the mailagent internal-auth middleware.

### Security (Medium)

- **`services/github_task_sync_service.py` — cross-workspace
  `[slug:task-key]` auto-link** (WS-083). `_find_aexy_task` resolved by
  workspace slug alone, so a malicious PR body in repo X (owned by
  workspace A) containing `[victim-workspace:42]` could create a
  `TaskGitHubLink` row pointing at workspace B's task. The lookup now
  requires the resolved task's workspace to have actively adopted the
  mentioning repo (`WorkspaceRepository.is_active`).
- **`api/tracking.py` — four POST endpoints trusted body refs**
  (WS-084). `submit_standup`, `create_work_log`, `log_time`, and
  `report_blocker` accepted `task_id`/`sprint_id`/`team_id` from the
  request body without scoping; the row was stamped with the caller's
  first team's workspace. Replaced with `_resolve_tracking_workspace`
  which derives the workspace from the supplied refs (in
  task → sprint → team priority), rejects bodies that mix refs across
  workspaces, and asserts the caller is an active member of the
  resolved workspace.
- **`api/developer_insights.py` — non-admins received `author_email`
  PII** (WS-085). `list_developer_commits` returned the raw email
  field for every active workspace member. Added `_is_workspace_admin`
  helper that gates the field on owner/admin role; non-admins receive
  `null`.
- **`mailagent/main.py` — empty `internal_secret` failed open in prod**
  (WS-086). When the shared secret was missing, the middleware silently
  passed every request through to handlers. Mailagent now raises
  `RuntimeError` at boot when `environment in {production, staging}`
  and the secret is empty; dev/test continue to pass through with the
  existing warning.
- **`auth/callback/page.tsx` — JWT lingered in URL bar and Referer**.
  The OAuth callback hung onto `?token=…` in the address bar until the
  next navigation. Now scrubbed via `history.replaceState` before any
  token use, mirroring the `/p/[publicSlug]` flow.
- **`/p/[publicSlug]/page.tsx` — public-slug login didn't sync the
  presence cookie**. The page wrote `token` to localStorage but skipped
  `setAuthPresenceCookie()`, reintroducing the redirect-loop class that
  `5895c1da` had fixed for the landing page. Cookie now set inline.

### Security (Low)

- **`lib/authCookie.ts` — presence cookie missing `Secure`**. Added
  `Secure` attribute on HTTPS so the flag isn't sent in cleartext if a
  proxy ever downgrades the connection.
- **`AnalyticsDetailsModal.tsx` — external commit links missing
  `noopener`**. `rel="noreferrer"` only; added `noopener` for explicit
  tabnabbing defense (modern browsers imply it, but the codebase
  convention is to set both).

### Frontend

- **i18n compliance on `AnalyticsDetailsModal.tsx`**. Per CLAUDE.md's
  rule that all user-facing strings in new components must use
  `useTranslations()`, the modal's ~30 hardcoded English strings (tab
  labels, table headers, loading/empty states, etc.) are now driven
  by the new `insights.details` namespace in `messages/en` +
  `messages/hi`. The same pass i18n'd three new strings in
  `insights/page.tsx` (Sources / Profile / Show inactive / "still
  loading" toast).

### Tests

- **`tests/unit/test_dependency_authz.py` (new)** — six cases pinning
  the story- and task-dependency loader helpers: active member passes,
  cross-workspace caller gets 404, missing id gets 404, removed-status
  member is rejected.
- **`tests/unit/test_email_webhook_verify.py`** — four SNS signature
  tests (attacker cert URL rejected, valid sig accepted, tampered
  payload rejected, dev-mode short-circuit) plus replay-window tests
  for SendGrid and Mailgun. Refreshed the Mailgun happy-path fixtures
  to use current timestamps.
- **`tests/unit/test_github_issue_auto_link.py`** — `_adopt_repo`
  fixture that wires `Repository` + `WorkspaceRepository` for the test
  workspace; new `test_cross_workspace_slug_injection_is_blocked`
  exercising the WS-083 fix, plus `test_shared_adoption_still_links`
  pinning that shared-repo adoption still resolves correctly to the
  workspace whose slug was used.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-19

Code review cleanup of work that originated on the long-running
`agent-upgrade` branch (compliance/tracking/automation/assessment
modules). Three reviewers audited the code as it currently sits on
`main`; this release fixes the verified Critical and High findings.

### Security (workspace-scope authz)

- **`api/tracking.py` — Slack channel-config endpoints**. `GET /channels`,
  `POST /channels`, `PATCH /channels/{config_id}`, `DELETE /channels/{config_id}`
  now verify the caller is a member of the target workspace (`viewer` for
  read, `member` for write). Without it, an authenticated user in
  workspace A could enumerate, create, edit, or delete channel configs
  in workspace B.
- **`api/tracking.py` — team/sprint standup reads**.
  `GET /standups/team/{team_id}` now fetches the team and asserts
  workspace membership; `GET /standups/summary/{sprint_id}` does the
  same via the sprint's team. Previously any authed user could read any
  team or sprint's standup aggregate by guessing IDs.
- **`api/tracking.py` — task-scoped reads**. `GET /logs/task/{task_id}`
  and `GET /time/task/{task_id}` now fetch the task and verify the
  caller is a member of the task's workspace before returning logs or
  time entries.
- **`api/tracking.py` — blocker mutations**. `PATCH /blockers/{id}/resolve`
  and `PATCH /blockers/{id}/escalate` now require workspace
  membership (`member` role) before allowing state transitions.
  Previously any authed user could resolve or escalate any blocker by
  guessing its UUID.
- **`api/tracking.py` — `GET /blockers/active`**. Without an explicit
  `team_id`, the endpoint was returning blockers across all
  workspaces. It now scopes the query to workspaces the caller is a
  member of (`WorkspaceService.list_user_workspaces`); if `team_id`
  is supplied, it verifies workspace membership for that team first.
- **`api/assessments.py` — workspace-scope authz across all authed
  endpoints**. Added two helpers:
  - `_assert_workspace_access(db, organization_id, developer_id, role)`
    for endpoints that take an `organization_id` directly
    (`POST /`, `GET /`, `GET /organization/{id}/metrics`).
  - `_assert_assessment_access(db, assessment_id, developer_id, role)`
    that fetches the assessment and asserts workspace membership,
    returning the loaded `Assessment`.
  Applied to: `create_assessment`, `list_assessments`, `get_assessment`,
  `update_assessment`, `delete_assessment`, `clone_assessment`,
  `get_wizard_status`, all five `step/N` endpoints, `list_topics`,
  `suggest_topics`, `list_questions`, `create_question`, `update_question`,
  `delete_question`, `generate_questions`, `list_candidates`,
  `add_candidate`, `import_candidates`, `remove_candidate`,
  `resend_candidate_invite`, `get_email_template`, `update_email_template`,
  `pre_publish_check`, `publish_assessment`, `get_assessment_metrics`,
  `get_organization_metrics`, `reevaluate_candidate`,
  `get_candidate_details`. Public-token endpoints
  (`/public/{public_token}/*`) are out of scope (intentionally
  unauthenticated). Previously any authed developer could read or mutate
  assessments in any organization by guessing UUIDs.

### Fixed

- **N+1 query in `get_team_tracking_dashboard`**
  (`backend/src/aexy/api/tracking.py`). The per-member developer fetch
  loop was issuing one `SELECT Developer WHERE id = ?` per team member;
  it now batch-loads all developers in a single `IN` query and indexes
  by id.
- **11 automation activities silently using the 5-minute default
  timeout**. `temporal/dispatch.py` `ACTIVITY_CONFIG` now declares:
  `check_missed_standups`, `check_time_entry_thresholds`,
  `check_stale_blockers`, `detect_blocker_patterns`,
  `check_time_anomalies`, `check_standup_participation`,
  `check_approaching_due_assignments`, `check_overdue_assignments`,
  `check_expiring_certifications`, `check_expired_certifications`,
  `check_bulk_compliance_rates` — each with `STANDARD_RETRY` and a
  10-minute timeout to accommodate scheduled detection activities that
  loop over active workspaces.

### Removed

- Unused imports in `backend/src/aexy/api/tracking.py`:
  `from typing import Any` and
  `from aexy.services.automation_service import dispatch_automation_event`
  (dispatch is routed through `services/tracking_events.py` helpers).
  `WorkspaceService` is now imported at module scope.

### Not in scope (filed as follow-up work)

- Stub trigger handler implementations for `standup.streak` and
  `training.bulk_overdue` — need product/design input on thresholds
  before implementing.
- i18n migration for `NodePalette.tsx` and the reminder/tracking
  pages — separate, larger effort that needs translator coordination.
- Test coverage for `tracking_events.py`,
  `tracking_compliance_config.py`, `compliance_service.py`,
  `hiring_intelligence.py`, `assessment_service.py`.

## [0.7.91] - 2026-05-19

Replace manual GitHub issue/PR linking with mention-based auto-linking
via `[workspace-slug:task-key]` in PR or issue title/body.

### Added

- **Issue webhook now auto-links tasks**. `api/webhooks.py` routes
  `issues` events (opened/reopened/edited/closed) through
  `GitHubTaskSyncService.process_issue`, which parses the issue title +
  body for `[slug:key]` mentions and upserts a `TaskGitHubLink` row per
  match with `is_auto_linked=True`. Works from any repo — the slug
  resolves against `Workspace.slug`, the number against the
  workspace-wide `task_key`.
- **Edit re-sync**. On `pull_request.edited`/`synchronize` and
  `issues.edited`, auto-links whose mention is no longer present in the
  fresh body are deleted. Manual edits to the GitHub source are now the
  way to add or remove links.
- **`link_issue_manually` is now upsert**. If a row already exists for
  `(task_id, repo, number)`, its cached `github_issue_title`/`state`/`url`
  refresh when fresher values arrive (issue renamed on GitHub →
  link metadata updates).
- **Copy-mention chip** in the task modal showing `[slug:task_key]`
  inline help so users know what to paste into a PR/issue body.

### Removed

- **Manual link POST endpoints** in both `api/sprint_tasks.py` and
  `api/project_tasks.py`:
  `POST /github-links/pull-requests` and `POST /github-links/issues`.
- **Orphan search endpoints** that only powered the manual dropdowns:
  `GET /github/pull-requests`, `GET /github/issues`,
  `GET /{task_id}/github-links/issue-repositories` (both scopes).
- **Manual linking UI** in `board/page.tsx` — the PR + issue
  search dropdowns, the manual `owner/repo#123` entry, and ~300 lines
  of supporting state/queries/mutations.
- **Client functions** `linkPullRequest`, `linkGitHubIssue`,
  `searchPullRequests`, `searchGitHubIssues`, and
  `getGitHubIssueRepositoryContext` from `lib/api.ts` (sprint and team
  scopes). `getTaskGitHubLinks` and `unlinkGitHubLink` retained.

### Tests

- `tests/unit/test_github_issue_auto_link.py` — process_issue creates
  one auto-linked row per mention, case-insensitive slug match,
  hyphens in slug, edit-then-remove drops the stale row, edit refreshes
  cached title/state, `closed`/`reopened` refresh state without
  pruning (only `edited` is allowed to remove mentions).

## [0.7.90] - 2026-05-19

Fix duplicate developer rows in team insights, plus auto-hide
zero-contribution members.

### Fixed

- **Ghost dedup**: `compute_team_distribution` now takes a `member_ids`
  list distinct from the activity-expanded `developer_ids`, so
  `_build_developer_alias_map` can actually map ghost ids onto their
  canonical workspace-member rows. The prior code passed the same
  list as both args, which made the `NOT IN` filter exclude the
  ghosts we wanted to bridge — producing two rows for "Ritesh
  Biswas" (active vs ghost-with-personal-email) on the team insights
  endpoint.
- **`identity_key` fallbacks** when a developer has no
  `GitHubConnection`:
  1. Pull `Commit.author_github_login` (most-frequent value per
     developer) and use it as the github login key.
  2. Parse `<id>+<login>@users.noreply.github.com` out of the
     developer's email. Together these collapse the two Mobashir
     ghost rows that shared the same GitHub login but were never
     linked to a Connection row.
- Aliased ghost ids are now removed from the display set so
  `_rollup_by_identity` never sees a ghost+canonical pair — fewer
  reliances on the identity_key tie-breaker.

### Added

- `compute_team_distribution(..., hide_zero_contribution=False)`
  optionally filters out members whose four counters (commits, PRs
  merged, lines changed, reviews given) are all zero in the window.
- `GET /workspaces/{id}/insights/team?include_inactive=false`
  (default) — applies the filter. `?include_inactive=true` restores
  the full roster.
- Frontend toggle "Show inactive" on the Team Insights page
  (`insights/page.tsx`) wired through `useTeamInsights` and the
  generated `getTeamInsights` client.
- Regression tests for: ghost-via-email collapse, ghost-via-commit-
  author-github-login collapse, and zero-contribution filter.

### Known limitation

- An active workspace member with neither a `GitHubConnection` nor
  any name/email overlap with their ghost rows cannot be linked
  automatically. The three "Mobashir" rows in the original example
  collapse from 3 → 2 (two ghosts merge), but the active member
  `mobashir.r@bimaplan.co` stays separate until either an admin
  links their GitHub login, or a manual "merge identities" action
  is added.

## [0.7.89] - 2026-05-19

Post-review hardening for the 0.7.82-0.7.88 workspace-scope leak audit.
The fixes were correct but a code review surfaced residual fail-open
edges and missing test coverage; this release closes those.

### Security

- **Webhook signature verification is now fail-closed by default**
  (`services/email_webhook_verify.py`). A new
  `webhooks_require_signing` setting (default `True`) replaces the
  prior behavior where each provider returned `True` when its env var
  was missing. SES, SendGrid, Mailgun, and Postmark all reject events
  outright when the required key isn't configured. Local development
  can flip the flag off to fall back to the old accept-with-warning
  behavior; production must keep the default.
- **Mailagent path-bypass closed** (`mailagent/middleware.py:44`).
  `_is_public_path` previously OR'd in `path.startswith(p)` (no
  trailing slash), so `/healthcheck-evil` could skip HMAC auth on the
  way to a route named with a public-prefix prefix. Tightened to
  exact-match OR `startswith(p + "/")`.
- **OAuth interceptor catches keyboard and programmatic navigation**
  (`frontend/src/lib/oauth.ts`). The 0.7.85 implementation only
  listened on `mousedown`, breaking OAuth login for keyboard users
  (Tab + Enter on a focused login link) and any JS-driven navigation
  (`window.location.assign("/auth/github/login")`). Now also installs
  a capture-phase `keydown` listener and patches
  `window.location.{assign,replace}` + the `href` setter so the
  inflight marker is set on every navigation vector.
- **Public booking enumeration rate-limit applied to every GET**
  (`api/booking/public.py`). The 0.7.86 fix only guarded the workspace
  lookup endpoint; the teams/team-by-id/event-type/slots endpoints
  inherit the same throttle now via router-level `Depends`.
- **Frame-ancestors regex tightened** (`frontend/next.config.js`).
  Negative-lookahead now anchored to `embed/` so `/embedded-*` paths
  still receive `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and
  `frame-ancestors 'none'` instead of falling through both rules.

### Added

- `core/workspace_auth.py` — centralizes the
  `assert_active_member(db, workspace_id, developer_id)` and
  `assert_resource_in_workspace(db, model, id, workspace_id)`
  helpers used across the 0.7.82-0.7.88 fixes. Call sites in
  `app_access.py` and `manager_learning.py` switched to the helpers;
  remaining inline copies will migrate opportunistically.
- Regression tests:
  - `backend/tests/unit/test_email_webhook_verify.py` — pins the
    fail-closed default for all four providers and the SubscribeURL
    SSRF guard.
  - `backend/tests/unit/test_workspace_auth.py` — pins membership
    checks (active vs pending/suspended/removed) and the
    resource-in-workspace mismatch case.
  - `mailagent/tests/test_internal_auth_middleware.py` — pins the
    public-path matcher against prefix-bypass paths and the HMAC
    sign/verify wire-format round-trip between backend and mailagent.
  - `frontend/src/test/oauth.test.ts` — pins `safeInternalPath`
    against open-redirect inputs and round-trips
    `stashPostLoginRedirect`.

### Changed

- Middleware redirect to `/?next=...` is now consumed.
  `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` stashes the (validated) `next` path in
  `sessionStorage` for the OAuth flow, and `useSetToken` honours it
  after onboarding completes. Open-redirect protection enforced by
  `safeInternalPath`.

## [0.7.88] - 2026-05-19

Closes the last 9 `suspect` rows in the workspace-scope leak tracker.
Five close as fixed with concrete patches; four close as verified-`ok`
or covered by prior fixes. Tracker is now zero open across every
severity.

### Security

- **App access** (WS-053) — `update_member_access` and
  `apply_template_to_member` (`api/app_access.py`) now verify the
  target `developer_id` is an active `WorkspaceMember` of the route's
  workspace, and that the `applied_template_id` belongs to that
  workspace (or is a system template with `workspace_id` NULL).
- **Manager learning** (WS-055) — `create_learning_goal`
  (`api/manager_learning.py`) verifies `data.developer_id` is an
  active `WorkspaceMember` of `current_workspace_id` before stamping
  a goal. Approval/budget routes follow the existing-goal chain so
  they inherit the same scope.
- **Custom reports** (WS-049) — `ReportBuilderService.list_reports`
  no longer surfaces `is_public=True` reports cross-tenant in the
  default listing. Public reports now require an explicit matching
  `organization_id` filter to appear. The reports route doesn't
  pass `organization_id` today, so the default listing returns the
  caller's own reports only.
- **Tracking helper** (WS-020) — `get_developer_team`
  (`api/tracking.py`) now accepts an optional `workspace_id` and
  constrains the team join via `Team.workspace_id`. Existing call
  sites keep historical "first team found" semantics; workspace-
  prefixed routes can opt in.

### Documentation

- Tracker rows WS-015 (exports), WS-016 (code insights), WS-017
  (sprint analytics), WS-018 (public renderers), WS-019 (learning
  services) closed as verified-`ok` or covered by prior fixes
  (WS-009, WS-039, WS-041, WS-051, WS-055, WS-060, WS-061, WS-066,
  WS-067, WS-068, WS-074). Each row now records the evidence used to
  close it.

## [0.7.87] - 2026-05-19

Closes the seven `Medium`/`Low` confirmed rows in the workspace-scope
leak tracker (WS-013, WS-065, WS-069, WS-070, WS-075, WS-082, WS-083).

### Security

- **Leave approver lookup** (WS-013) —
  `LeaveRequestService._find_approver` now joins `Team` and constrains
  `Team.workspace_id == workspace_id`, so a developer's team lead in
  another workspace can no longer become the approver on this
  workspace's leave requests.
- **Roadmap requests** (WS-065) — added `_check_roadmap_rate_limit`
  (Redis sliding window: 10 creates / 50 votes per developer per
  hour) on `public_projects.create_roadmap_request` and
  `vote_roadmap_request`. Caps the spam vector while keeping the
  public roadmap open to any authenticated developer.
- **One-click unsubscribe** (WS-069) — `/u/{token}` now serves a
  confirmation page on GET and only mutates subscriber state on POST.
  Email prefetchers and link-checkers no longer trigger unsubscribes
  while mail clients implementing RFC 8058's `List-Unsubscribe-Post`
  still work.
- **Email click tracker** (WS-070) — `_record_click_event` resolves
  the `?r=<recipient_id>` query parameter and drops the attribution
  if `recipient.campaign_id != link.campaign_id`. The click is still
  recorded at the link level; only the forged per-recipient
  attribution is rejected.
- **Webhook rate limits** (WS-082) — `_enforce_webhook_rate_limit`
  (Redis sliding window) applied to `/webhooks/github` (600 per IP
  per minute) and `/webhooks/automations/{id}/trigger` (60 per
  automation per minute). Caps Temporal workflow / LLM token spam.
- **Webhook source-IP capture** (WS-083) —
  `/webhooks/automations/{id}/trigger` now records `source_ip` via
  the shared `get_client_ip` helper instead of `request.client.host`,
  so the captured IP honours `X-Forwarded-For` behind a load
  balancer.
- **`(app)/layout.tsx`** (WS-075) — adds `queryClient.clear()` before
  the `isResolved && !isAuthenticated` redirect fires, eliminating
  the brief window during a cross-tab logout where ghost-cached
  React Query workspace data could be visible. The workspace-scoped
  providers (`ChatWebSocketProvider`, `WorkspaceSearchPalette`,
  `FloatingChatWidget`) were already gated on
  `isResolved && isAuthenticated`.

## [0.7.86] - 2026-05-19

Closes the remaining `High` rows in the workspace-scope leak tracker
(WS-060, WS-061, WS-067, WS-068) plus seven related Medium/Low rows on
the public/embed surface. Tracker now has zero open `Critical` or `High`
items.

### Security

- **Public booking surface** (`booking/public.py`) —
  `get_workspace_teams`, `get_team_info`, and the booking confirmation
  response no longer leak member emails. Only `id`/`name`/`avatar_url`
  is exposed. A new Redis-backed per-IP rate limit (30/min) gates
  `GET /public/book/{workspace_slug}` to make slug enumeration costly.
  Closes WS-060, WS-064.
- **Public project surface** (`public_projects.py`) — added
  `_project_team_ids` helper. Backlog, board, stories, goals, roadmap,
  sprints, and timeline endpoints now intersect with `ProjectTeam` /
  `GoalProject` so a public project never leaks data from the other
  projects in the same workspace. `_fetch_sprints_with_stats` accepts
  a `team_ids` parameter; all callers now pass it. No schema migration
  required. Closes WS-061.
- **Calendar OAuth** (`booking/calendars.py`) — `start_oauth` signs
  `settings.frontend_url` into state instead of the request `Origin`
  header. Callback always redirects to `settings.frontend_url`,
  ignoring any legacy signed value. Open-redirect via OAuth state is
  closed. Closes WS-063.
- **Booking webhook admin CRUD** (`booking/webhooks.py`) — added
  `_require_workspace_admin` helper applied to every route
  (list/create/get/secret/update/delete/test). An authenticated user
  from workspace A can no longer read/modify webhooks (or their HMAC
  secrets) for workspace B. Closes WS-062.
- **Public table share links** (`public_tables.py`,
  `models/crm.py`) — added `TableShareLink.allowed_origins` column
  (migration `backend/scripts/migrate_table_share_link_allowed_origins.
  sql`) plus `_origin_matches` helper. Every `/public/tables/{token}*`
  route now rejects requests whose `Origin` header isn't in the link's
  allowlist (NULL/empty preserves legacy behaviour). Closes WS-066,
  WS-074.
- **Assessment public-take** (`assessment_take.py`) —
  `get_assessment_by_public_token_or_id` no longer accepts the
  assessment UUID as a fallback for the public token; only
  `public_token` matches. Candidate creation in `start_assessment`
  goes through a Redis sliding-window rate limit
  (`_check_candidate_create_rate_limit`): 5 candidates per IP per hour
  and 50 per assessment per hour. Email-verification flow remains
  backlog. Closes WS-067 fully and WS-068 partial.
- **RSVP** (`booking/booking_service.py`) — `respond_to_rsvp` is now
  single-shot: refuses to process an attendee that already has
  `responded_at` set, and rotates `response_token` after the first
  use. A leaked email link can no longer be replayed to flip the
  response later. Closes WS-076.

## [0.7.85] - 2026-05-19

Closes the remaining four `Critical` and most of the `High` rows in the
workspace-scope leak tracker: frontend OAuth + framing hardening,
mailagent isolation, automation webhook signing, and per-provider email
webhook signature verification.

### Security

- **Automation webhook HMAC** (WS-056) — `POST /webhooks/automations/
  {id}/trigger` now requires `X-Aexy-Signature: sha256=<hex>` over the
  raw body, verified with a per-automation HMAC secret derived as
  `HMAC(settings.secret_key, "automation:" + automation_id)`. Lets us
  ship signature verification without a `webhook_secret` column
  migration on `CRMAutomation`; the UI surfaces this derived value as
  the automation's webhook secret. `record_id` is now constrained to
  `CRMRecord.workspace_id == automation.workspace_id` before loading.
- **Email provider webhooks** (WS-057, WS-058, WS-081) — new
  `services/email_webhook_verify.py` implements:
  - SendGrid: ECDSA over `timestamp + body` against the configured
    public key (`X-Twilio-Email-Event-Webhook-Signature`).
  - Mailgun: HMAC over `timestamp + token` with the signing key.
  - Postmark: HTTP Basic Auth against the configured `user:pass`.
  - SES (via SNS): topic-ARN allowlist plus a hostname check on the
    SNS `SubscribeURL` that restricts auto-confirmation to
    `sns.<region>.amazonaws.com` (fixes the prior blind-SSRF).
  Each provider handler now resolves the workspace from the
  signature-verified sender via `SendingDomain.domain` lookup first,
  and only falls back to the legacy `message_id` lookup when no
  matching sending domain exists. New settings:
  `sendgrid_webhook_public_key`, `mailgun_webhook_signing_key`,
  `postmark_webhook_basic_auth`, `ses_sns_topic_arn_allowlist`.
- **Mailagent zero-auth** (WS-077, WS-078, WS-079, WS-080) — new
  `mailagent/middleware.py` `InternalAuthMiddleware` requires
  `X-Mailagent-Signature: HMAC-SHA256(internal_secret, timestamp + "." +
  body)` on every non-public route with a ±5min replay window. The
  Aexy backend's `mailagent_client._request` signs every outbound call
  when `settings.mailagent_signing_secret` is configured. CORS now
  only mounts when `cors_allowed_origins` is set (default empty —
  server-to-server only), and `allow_credentials` is False. `/send/
  email` validates `from_address.domain` against the verified
  `mailagent_domains` catalog and strips arbitrary headers down to a
  whitelist of threading/unsubscribe ones. Per-workspace
  `EmailProvider` isolation (full WS-079) is parked as a backlog
  item — the unauthenticated-access vector is now closed.
- **Frontend OAuth callback** (WS-071b) — `/auth/callback` now calls
  `consumeOAuthInflight()` and rejects the URL token (redirects to
  `/?error=oauth_state_missing`) when the marker isn't present. A new
  document-level `OAuthInflightTagger` (mounted in `providers.tsx`)
  watches mousedown events for any `<a href>` matching
  `/auth/<provider>/(login|connect|connect-crm)` and sets the marker
  just before navigation. Catches the inline anchor login buttons in
  `app/page.tsx` and `LandingHeader.tsx` without modifying every
  callsite. The matching `/p/[publicSlug]` handler (WS-071) is
  refactored to use the same shared `lib/oauth.ts` helper.
- **Frontend middleware auth gate** (WS-072) — `middleware.ts` now
  redirects auth-required path prefixes to `/?next=<path>` when the
  `aexy_authed` presence cookie is absent. The cookie is mirrored from
  `localStorage["token"]` by `useAuth` on mount and at
  `setToken`/`logout`. The JWT itself remains in localStorage and is
  still validated by the API; the cookie just prevents the SSR app
  shell from leaking placeholders to logged-out users.
- **Frame-ancestors / clickjacking** (WS-073) — `next.config.js` now
  configures `headers()`: `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + CSP
  `frame-ancestors 'none'` everywhere except `/embed/*` (which gets
  `frame-ancestors *` until per-link origin allowlisting moves to the
  API side under WS-074). Also adds `Referrer-Policy:
  strict-origin-when-cross-origin` and `X-Content-Type-Options:
  nosniff` site-wide.

## [0.7.84] - 2026-05-19

Closes 24 `High` and `Medium` ID-forgery rows in the workspace-scope leak
tracker (WS-010..014, WS-027..041, WS-044..047, WS-050..052, WS-054).
Each fix follows the same shape: load the referenced resource by id and
assert its `workspace_id` matches the route's workspace before delegating
to the service.

### Security

- **CRM notes & activities** (`crm.py`) — note CRUD and per-record
  activity list now verify `CRMRecord.workspace_id == workspace_id`
  before exposing sub-resources. Stops `POST /workspaces/A/crm/records/
  <B_record_id>/notes`. Closes WS-027, WS-028.
- **Data tables / forms** (`tables.py`, `forms.py`) — `list_fields`
  now 404s on cross-workspace tables; `delete_field` and
  `reorder_fields` verify form-in-workspace and field-in-form before
  mutating. Closes WS-029, WS-030.
- **AI agents** (`agents.py`, `agent_policies.py`,
  `automation_agents.py`) — added `_assert_agent_in_workspace` helper
  applied to all inbox actions (get/reply/escalate/archive/process),
  routing-rule delete, agent-policy create, and automation-agent
  trigger config. Routing-rule delete additionally verifies the rule
  belongs to the agent. Closes WS-031..034.
- **Goals / Epics / Stories / Releases / Sprint Tasks** — every
  cross-resource link operation now verifies the target shares the
  workspace: `link_project`, `link_epic`, `add_tasks_to_epic`,
  `add_tasks_to_story`, `add_sprint_to_release`,
  `add_stories_to_release`, and sprint-task bulk_assign/status/move.
  Sprint-task `bulk_move` also requires the target sprint to share
  the workspace. The `get_sprint_and_check_permission` helper now
  returns the sprint object so call-sites can scope queries to it.
  Closes WS-035..039.
- **On-call** (`oncall.py`) — `verify_workspace_access` now accepts
  `team_id` and asserts `Team.workspace_id == workspace_id`. All call
  sites updated. Closes WS-040.
- **Sprints by team** (`sprints.py`) — `list_sprints` and
  `get_active_sprint` verify `Team.workspace_id == workspace_id`.
  Closes WS-041.
- **Team calendar** (`team_calendar.py`) — three GET endpoints now
  require workspace viewer-role membership and (when `team_id` is
  supplied) verify the team's workspace. Closes WS-010.
- **Tracking team dashboard** (`tracking.py`) —
  `get_team_tracking_dashboard` now resolves the team's workspace and
  requires caller viewer-role before reading standups/blockers/time
  logs. Closes WS-011.
- **Dependency APIs** (`dependencies.py`) — added `_require_member_of`
  helper. Caller must be a member of the dependent story/task's
  workspace before creating or listing dependencies. Also fixed a
  pre-existing `session.add(...)` NameError on both `create_story_
  dependency` and `create_task_dependency`. Closes WS-012.
- **Chat** (`chat_service.py`, `chat.py`) — `update_message` and
  `delete_message` now accept `workspace_id` and constrain the lookup
  via a `ChatChannel.workspace_id` join. A sender who is a member of
  multiple workspaces can no longer edit a message in workspace B by
  hitting workspace A's route. Closes WS-014.
- **Leave management** (`leave.py`) — added generic
  `_assert_resource_in_workspace` helper. Applied to update/delete of
  `LeaveType` (admin-only), `LeavePolicy` (admin-only), `Holiday`
  (admin-only), and leave-request approve/reject/cancel/withdraw.
  `get_developer_balance` requires admin and verifies target is a
  workspace member; `get_team_balances` verifies `Team.workspace_id`.
  Closes WS-044..047.
- **Google email-to-record link** (`google_integration.py`) —
  `link_email_to_record` now verifies the CRM record belongs to the
  caller's workspace before inserting the link. Closes WS-050.
- **Entity activity / comments** (`entity_activity.py`) — added
  `_entity_model` mapping plus `_assert_entity_in_workspace` helper
  applied to both `create_activity` and `add_comment`. Validates the
  10 most common workspace-scoped entity types (task/story/epic/
  release/goal/crm_record/project/sprint/form/leave_request);
  remaining types continue to be stamped pending follow-up. Closes
  WS-051 (partial — see helper note).
- **Reminders** (`reminders.py`) — control-owner update/delete and
  domain-team-mapping delete now verify the target's `workspace_id`
  matches the route. Closes WS-052.
- **Planning poker** (`planning_poker.py`) —
  `get_poker_session_state` and the WebSocket entrypoint now resolve
  the sprint and require viewer-role membership of
  `sprint.workspace_id`. WebSocket rejects with 4003/4004 on miss.
  Closes WS-054.

## [0.7.83] - 2026-05-19

Continues the workspace-scope leak audit by closing four more `Critical`
rows from the tracker: three legacy unauthenticated APIs and the GitHub
webhook fail-open.

### Security

- Legacy analytics API (`/analytics/*`) — every endpoint now binds
  `current_user_id` (was discarded as `_`) and runs each request's
  `developer_ids` (or path `developer_id`) through a
  `_require_developers_visible` check that requires every target to
  share an active workspace with the caller. Rejects (403) the whole
  request rather than silently dropping invisible developers. Closes
  WS-007.
- Hiring intelligence API (`/hiring/*` section 1) — added
  `get_current_developer` to every route in the unauth section
  (team-gaps, bus-factor, roadmap-skills, requirements list/create/get
  /jd/rubric/scorecard/status). Helpers `_resolve_team_workspace_or_403`,
  `_require_developers_visible`, `_require_requirement_workspace_member`
  enforce workspace membership for the supplied `team_id` /
  `organization_id` / `requirement_id`. JD generation, rubric
  generation, requirement create/status update now require workspace
  admin role. Closes WS-008.
- Learning paths API (`/learning/*`) — all 16 endpoints require
  authentication. Personal endpoints (list paths, generate path,
  stretch tasks) require the caller to be the target developer or
  hold admin role in a workspace the developer is a member of.
  Path-scoped endpoints (get/regenerate/progress/milestones/activities
  /recommended courses) use `_require_path_access` to resolve owner
  via the path itself. Pause/resume/abandon are owner-only.
  Team-scoped overview and recommendations require active membership
  in the team's workspace. Closes WS-009.
- GitHub webhook (`/webhooks/github`) — fail-closed when a webhook
  secret is configured: the `X-Hub-Signature-256` header is now
  mandatory (401 if missing) and verified. When no secret is
  configured the route returns 503 unless `settings.debug` is True;
  prevents an empty/typoed env-var from turning ingestion into an
  open endpoint. Closes WS-059.

## [0.7.82] - 2026-05-19

This release closes nine `Critical` authentication-bypass issues uncovered
by a platform-wide workspace-scope leak audit. A third pass added 28 new
tracker rows (WS-056..WS-083) covering the frontend, public/embed
surfaces, mailagent, and webhook ingress, with one same-day fix applied
to a frontend session-hijack vector.

### Security

- Notifications API (`/notifications/*`) now binds the developer
  identity to the JWT via `Depends(get_current_developer_id)` on every
  one of its 19 endpoints. The previous `developer_id: str = Query(...)`
  parameter (used as authentication by every list/preference/push/admin
  route) is removed. Closes WS-042.
- Slack integration (`/slack/*`) — every admin-surface route now
  requires authentication and verifies the caller is an active
  owner/admin of the integration's workspace via a shared
  `require_integration_admin` helper. OAuth `/install` and `/connect`
  derive the installer id from the current user, not a query
  parameter. The signed webhook routes (`/commands`, `/events`,
  `/interactions`) and the OAuth `/callback` remain public as
  intended. Closes WS-043.
- Reviews API (`/reviews/*`) — the entire surface (~28 endpoints
  covering cycles, individual reviews, work goals, peer requests,
  contribution summaries) now requires `Depends(get_current_developer)`
  and enforces resource-appropriate authorization: cycle CRUD requires
  workspace admin; individual-review reads require reviewee / manager
  / peer-reviewer / workspace-admin; goal edits require ownership; peer
  request actions require the actual party. Closes WS-021 through
  WS-026.
- Predictive analytics (`/predictions/*`) now binds `current_user_id`
  (was discarded as `_`) and requires the caller to share an
  active workspace with the target developer at admin role for
  attrition / burnout / trajectory / insights endpoints. Team-health
  POST verifies admin permission in the supplied `team_id`'s
  workspace, or falls back to per-developer visibility. Closes WS-048.
- Frontend public project page (`/p/[publicSlug]`) no longer silently
  writes a URL `?token=` query parameter into `localStorage["token"]`.
  Token consumption now requires a one-shot `oauthInflight`
  sessionStorage marker set by the page's own OAuth login button
  immediately before navigating to the provider. Without that marker
  the token is stripped from the URL and discarded. Closes WS-071; the
  residual `/auth/callback` variant is tracked as WS-071b.

### Documentation

- Updated `docs/workspace-scope-leak-tracker.md` with 28 new findings
  (WS-056..WS-083) covering: cross-workspace CRMRecord pumping through
  the unauthenticated automation webhook (WS-056), every email
  provider webhook lacking signature verification (WS-057), an SSRF
  in the SES `SubscribeURL` auto-confirm flow (WS-058), GitHub
  webhook fail-open when no secret configured (WS-059), public
  project endpoints returning entire workspace's data rather than
  project-scoped data (WS-061), assessment public-token bypass
  (WS-067), Candidate fan-out without verification (WS-068),
  mailagent's zero-auth admin surface (WS-077), and cross-tenant
  event injection through `message_id` lookup (WS-081). Each existing
  fixed row was relabelled with file:line evidence pointing at the
  patch.

## [0.7.81] - 2026-05-19

This release hardens analytics authorization, scopes repository insights
strictly to adopted workspace repos, and adds an evidence drill-down on
the team insights page.

### Added

- Added an `AnalyticsDetailsModal` on the team insights page with
  Summary / Sources / Commits tabs surfacing the rows behind each
  aggregate. A workspace-admin-only Raw tab exposes the underlying
  JSON for debugging.
- Added `commits_synced`, `prs_synced`, `reviews_synced` to the
  workspace repository response, overlayed from the adopter's
  `DeveloperRepository` row so the catalog and analytics agree on sync
  state during the sync-pipeline migration.

### Changed

- Repository insights now intersect a workspace member's commits and PRs
  against the workspace's adopted-repo allow-list, so a member's
  personal or open-source contributions no longer leak into team-level
  insights.
- Team insights now refuse requests from non-active workspace members.
  Removed and suspended members keep their historical attribution but
  cannot keep calling analytics endpoints.
- Project and sprint PR search and the GitHub task sync explicitly scope
  by `WorkspaceRepository.workspace_id`, making the cross-workspace
  guarantee a query invariant instead of relying on data invariants.

### Security

- Closed six unauthenticated reads in `/intelligence/team/{workspace_id}`
  endpoints (burnout, expertise, collaboration, collaboration graph,
  complexity, technology) that previously returned data when the caller
  was not a workspace member.
- Gated the analytics modal Raw tab behind workspace admin so commit
  author emails are not exposed to non-admin viewers.
- Workspace-member-based authorization now uniformly requires active
  membership. A teammate marked as "left" keeps their historical
  attribution but can no longer read workspace notification settings,
  AI code insights, role-gated resources via `is_owner`, billing
  fallback workspaces, or per-app permission paths. Affects
  `notifications.py`, `code_insights.py`, `workspace_service.is_owner`,
  `billing.py` workspace selection, and `app_access_service` member
  lookup (which protects four downstream config callsites).

### Fixed

- Fixed a `NameError` in the project PR search endpoint where the team
  variable was bound in the wrong function.

## [0.7.80] - 2026-05-19

This release improves developer identity handling in insights and adds
soft member offboarding for workspaces.

### Added

- Added a developer ghost dedupe utility for merging name-variant ghost
  contributors into canonical workspace members after safe dry-run review.
- Added workspace member status toggles so admins can mark teammates as
  left and restore them later without deleting membership history.
- Added member identity metadata to team insights responses, including
  email, GitHub login, avatar, identity key, and membership status.

### Changed

- Team insights now roll up duplicate contributor rows by identity and
  compute per-member averages from the rolled-up contributor set.
- The compare page now deduplicates remaining identity twins, supports
  search across identity fields, and hides past or external contributors
  behind explicit toggles.
- Organization settings can show past members and sorts removed members
  below active teammates.

## [0.7.79] - 2026-05-18

This release improves the employee-facing review experience and reuses
the peer-reviewer invitation flow across manager and self-nomination
surfaces.

### Added

- Added `/reviews/my-reviews/[reviewId]` so employees can open their own
  review, submit self-review notes, nominate peer reviewers when allowed,
  track peer-review request status, and acknowledge completed manager
  reviews.
- Added a shared `InvitePeerReviewersModal` that supports both manager
  assignment and employee self-nomination modes while preventing duplicate
  active reviewer invites.
- Added direct “Open your review” CTAs from the reviews dashboard and
  review cycle detail page when the current user is enrolled in the
  active cycle.

### Changed

- Replaced the route-local peer reviewer assignment modal with the shared
  review component.
- Refined review page copy and routing so participants land on their own
  actionable review surface instead of the admin-oriented cycle view.

## [0.7.78] - 2026-05-18

This release resolves frontend TypeScript drift across app surfaces and
centralizes repeated marketing-page icon tuple types.

### Added

- Added shared landing-page marketing types for icon rows and capability
  cards so AI Company OS, AI Agents, CRM, and GTM Intelligence pages can
  reuse one typed tuple shape.

### Changed

- Updated frontend API types to match current backend response shapes for
  workspaces, plans, reviews, OKRs, campaigns, tables, agents, GTM,
  planning poker, chat, and analytics payloads.
- Adjusted React 19 ref and JSX namespace usage, Recharts formatter
  signatures, cloneElement icon typing, and fixture annotations so
  TypeScript can validate without local casts.
- Removed stale onboarding use of the removed repository-enable API and
  aligned sprint backlog deletion with the existing archive task action.

### Fixed

- Fixed TypeScript errors across chat, reminders, docs, CRM/tables,
  onboarding, sprint, GTM, insights, e2e fixtures, and marketing pages.

## [0.7.77] - 2026-05-18

This release improves performance review workflows with peer-review
detail pages, manager assignment tools, phase controls, and automated
deadline reminders.

### Added

- Added peer-review request detail pages where reviewers can accept,
  decline, and submit focused feedback from a notification link.
- Added manager peer-reviewer assignment UI on individual review pages.
- Added review-cycle activation and deadline-reminder notification types
  with templates and delivery helpers.
- Added a daily Temporal deadline sweep for T-7, T-3, and T-1 review
  reminders, plus a migration to track sent reminders per cycle.

### Changed

- Review cycle list and detail pages now expose activate and advance-phase
  actions with refreshed table/menu behavior.
- Review cycle activation now notifies enrolled participants when the
  cycle opens.

## [0.7.76] - 2026-05-18

This release makes AI token usage visible and billable at the workspace
level, and adds raw commit detail behind developer insights.

### Added

- Added workspace-level month-to-date LLM counters, provider breakdowns,
  overage cost tracking, and an idempotent migration for the new workspace
  usage columns.
- Added `GET /workspaces/{workspace_id}/llm-usage` so any workspace
  member can inspect current AI token consumption and reset timing.
- Added workspace AI usage cards to billing and insights settings.
- Added a developer commits endpoint and table so developer insights can
  show the underlying synced commits behind aggregate metrics.

### Changed

- AI analysis activities now roll commit, PR, and review token usage into
  every workspace that has adopted the analyzed repository.
- Billing usage now reads workspace token counters when the caller belongs
  to a workspace, while preserving legacy developer counters as fallback.

## [0.7.75] - 2026-05-17

This release tightens the AI insights experience after the initial
code-insights rollout, with better contributor-claim flows, more resilient
LLM execution, and clearer loading states.

### Added

- Added an auto-detecting claim banner on insights pages so developers can
  reclaim orphaned GitHub commit, PR, and review activity without leaving
  the context where missing activity is visible.
- Added shared code-insight card skeletons to keep digest and repository
  health panels stable while AI snapshots load.
- Added identity-page success messaging and richer claim metrics for
  commits, PRs, and reviews.

### Changed

- Expanded ghost contributor matching to include GitHub no-reply email
  attribution, not only email-null contributor rows.
- Wrapped commit, PR, and review AI analysis calls with inline
  rate-limit waits so Temporal activities are less likely to burn retries
  during LLM concurrency spikes.
- Increased DeepSeek read timeouts for long-tail completions while keeping
  connection failures fast.
- Refined AI digest cards and insights pages with improved empty/loading
  states and contributor-claim entry points.

## [0.7.74] - 2026-05-17

AI code insights now run across GitHub commits, pull requests, reviews,
and sprint task links, with workspace controls for enabling analysis and
new UI surfaces for reading the results.

### Added

#### AI code insights
- Added code-insight API endpoints for commit, pull request, review,
  similar-PR, reviewer-suggestion, task-PR alignment, and snapshot
  retrieval workflows.
- Added Temporal activities and schedules for artifact analysis, weekly
  developer digests, repository health summaries, active PR refreshes,
  task-to-PR alignment, and performance-review summaries.
- Added LLM analysis cache, deterministic security scanning, PR
  embeddings, AI settings, and migration scripts for the new storage
  columns and snapshot tables.

#### Product surfaces
- Added frontend code-insight hooks, API client helpers, localized
  messages, and cards/panels for AI summaries in developer, repository,
  review, sprint board, and settings pages.
- Added identity settings messaging and navigation surfaces for the
  organization/settings area.

### Changed

- GitHub sync now enriches commits and PRs with deterministic metadata,
  supports branch-aware commit collection, and fans out AI analysis after
  repository sync.
- Developer identity handling can claim and merge ghost contributor
  activity into the authenticated GitHub developer profile.
- Coverage artifacts are ignored so regenerated test output stays out of
  normal commits.

## [0.7.73] - 2026-05-12

Tasks now have a copyable per-workspace identifier and a short
shareable link. Format is `[{workspace_slug}:{task_key}]` (e.g.
`[aexy:42]`); the bracketed form doubles as an auto-link token in
GitHub PR/issue titles. The kanban task card surfaces two icon-only
copy actions on hover — full link / full identifier shown on hover,
copied on click.

### Added

#### Shareable task identifiers
A new monotonic per-workspace counter assigns a `task_key` to every
new task. Combined with `workspace.slug` it forms the displayed
identifier `[slug:N]`, rendered as a subtle monospace prefix on the
kanban card title and used as the body of two new copy actions in
the card's hover quick-actions bar. Existing tasks are backfilled
in `created_at` order per workspace.

- New columns: `sprint_tasks.task_key` (int, unique per workspace)
  and `workspaces.next_task_key` (counter). Migration
  `migrate_task_keys.sql` adds them, backfills existing tasks, and
  seeds each workspace counter to `MAX(task_key) + 1`.
- Atomic assignment via a SQLAlchemy `before_insert` event on
  `SprintTask` — one `UPDATE ... RETURNING` consumes the next key
  and serializes concurrent inserts. Covers all task-creation paths
  (manual, GitHub import, Jira, Linear, workflows, templates,
  planning poker) without touching their call sites.
- `SprintTaskResponse` exposes `task_key`, `workspace_slug`,
  `identifier`, and `public_url` so the frontend can render and
  copy without recomposing the string.

#### Public short-link route
A short URL at `/t/{workspace_slug}/{task_key}` resolves to the
sprint kanban for the task, with the task drawer auto-opened.

- New backend endpoint `GET /api/v1/tasks/by-key/{slug}/{key}`
  returns the task UUID plus the sprint and project IDs needed to
  build the redirect. Auth-gated on workspace membership.
- New frontend route `frontend/src/app/(app)/t/[workspaceSlug]/[taskKey]/page.tsx`
  calls the resolver and `router.replace`s to
  `/sprints/{project_id}/{sprint_id}?task={uuid}` (or the project
  backlog when the task has no sprint).
- The sprint kanban page reads `?task=<uuid>` on mount, opens the
  task drawer for that task, and strips the param so refresh
  doesn't re-open it.

#### GitHub PR/issue title auto-linking
The task reference parser learns a new pattern for the native
`[workspace-slug:N]` form. When a PR or issue is ingested with that
bracket in its title, `GitHubTaskSyncService` resolves the matching
task by `(workspace.slug, task_key)` and creates a `TaskGitHubLink`
with `is_auto_linked=True`.

- New `AEXY_BRACKETED_PATTERN` regex
  `\[([a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*):(\d+)\]` in `task_reference_parser.py`,
  exposed as `TaskReferenceSource.AEXY`. Distinct from the existing
  `[PROJ-123]` Jira/Linear pattern (the colon separator avoids the
  collision).
- Already wired into the runtime webhook path
  (`/webhooks/github`) for both PRs and commits — no behavior change
  for past PRs that didn't use this format, future ones link
  automatically.

#### Card UI
- Two icon-only buttons in `TaskCardPremium`'s hover quick-actions
  bar: `Link2` copies the public URL, `Hash` copies the identifier.
  Full string in the `title=` tooltip; Sonner toast on click.
- Persistent monospace `[slug:N]` prefix on the card title so the
  identifier is visible at a glance without hovering.

## [0.7.72] - 2026-05-07

Project-level (sprint-less) tasks reach feature parity with sprint
tasks. Backlog tasks can now carry attachments, attach GitHub PRs and
issues, accept comments, and surface a full activity history; several
silently-dropped fields on create/update across both routes are
plugged; the History tab now logs every meaningful task mutation
including archives, sprint moves, and planning-poker estimates; and
repository connection moves from per-developer to workspace-scoped.

### Added

#### Workspace + project repository connection
Repositories are connected at the **workspace** level now, with
projects picking subsets. New tables `workspace_repositories` (the
workspace's adopted catalog) and `team_repositories` (the project's
selection) replace `DeveloperRepository.is_enabled` as the source of
truth for "which repos are tracked here." Migration
`migrate_workspace_team_repositories.sql` backfills both from
existing per-developer enables so nothing in scope today disappears.

- New endpoints: `GET/POST/DELETE /workspaces/{id}/repositories`
  (admin), `GET/POST/DELETE /teams/{id}/repositories`, plus
  `POST /workspaces/{id}/repositories/{wr_id}/reclaim` for the
  former-member adoption flow.
- `WorkspaceRepositoryService` exposes the adopt / unadopt /
  reclaim / link-team / unlink-team / pick_installation_developer
  surface; the canonical sync state (sync_status, last_sync_at,
  webhook bookkeeping, incremental cursors) lives on
  `workspace_repositories` since sync is workspace-owned now.
- Free-plan repo cap is now per-workspace.
  `LimitsService.can_adopt_repository(workspace_id)` counts active
  rows against the workspace's effective plan and gates the adopt
  endpoint. Removes the per-developer counter from the gating path
  (still used as a display-only roll-up on the limits widget).
- Consumers swapped: PR search (sprint + project), GitHub issue
  search/import, the auto-sync Temporal scheduler, developer
  insights, sync-status. Per-developer enable/disable endpoints
  are removed; the column `DeveloperRepository.is_enabled` stays
  as a discovery cache and gets cleaned up in a follow-up.
- New project settings tab at
  `/settings/projects/{projectId}/repositories` for picking which
  workspace repos a project tracks.
- Former-member adoption UX: a "Reclaim" banner on
  `/settings/repositories` lists `workspace_repositories` whose
  adopter is no longer an active workspace member, with a one-click
  "Reclaim" action that re-binds the row to the active member who
  clicked it (or any active member with reach as a fallback).
  `WorkspaceRepository.sync_status='no_credentials'` is set
  automatically when the auto-sync scheduler can't get a token,
  surfacing the same banner.
- Frontend rewires `handleRepoToggle` on `/settings/repositories`
  to call `workspaceRepositoriesApi.adopt` / `unadopt` instead of
  the removed per-developer endpoints; existing UI keeps working,
  the toggle now adopts into the current workspace.



#### Backlog tasks can carry attachments
Sprint-less project tasks had attachment upload gated behind a "Move
this task into a sprint to upload attachments" banner because the
only attachment routes lived under `/sprints/{sprint_id}/tasks/...`.
Added parallel endpoints under `/teams/{team_id}/tasks/{task_id}/attachments`
(POST / GET / DELETE) authorised via team membership. Both routers now
share the same upload, list, and delete logic via a new
`backend/src/aexy/services/task_attachment_service.py` (S3 put,
storage-quota assertion, AI metadata pipeline dispatch, S3 delete,
quota-cache invalidation — all in one place). The frontend picks the
right endpoint based on `task.sprint_id`; the gate banner is gone.

#### Backlog tasks can attach pull requests and GitHub issues
The PR linking section in the task modal now works for project-level
tasks — new endpoints `GET /teams/{team_id}/tasks/github/pull-requests`
and `POST /teams/{team_id}/tasks/{task_id}/github-links/pull-requests`
mirror the sprint-scoped equivalents (workspace-membership check on
the PR author preserved). The list endpoint at
`/teams/{team_id}/tasks/{task_id}/github-links` now returns both issue
and PR links (previously filtered to `github_issue` only). The
`EditTaskModal` dispatches search and link mutations to either endpoint
based on whether the task has a `sprint_id`.

#### Project-level GitHub issue import
New `POST /teams/{team_id}/tasks/import` (with
`projectTasksApi.importTasks` on the frontend) imports GitHub issues
into the team's backlog without requiring a sprint, populating the
"Select issue" dropdown across every task in the team. New service
helpers `add_project_task` and `_import_project_task_items` keep the
import dedup keyed on `(team_id, source_type, source_id)`.

#### Backlog tasks show activity history and accept comments
The History tab previously rendered "Move this task into a sprint to
view its full activity history" for sprint-less tasks because the only
activities + comments routes were sprint-scoped. Added the matching
team-scoped routes (`GET /teams/{team_id}/tasks/{task_id}/activities`
and `POST /teams/{team_id}/tasks/{task_id}/comments`) and updated
`AssignmentHistoryPanel` to dispatch by `task.sprint_id` vs
`task.team_id`. Activity rows are keyed on `task_id` only on the model
side, so existing per-task creation / status / assignment / field-change
events surface for backlog tasks without any data backfill.

#### History tab now logs every meaningful task mutation
Audit pass on every place that mutates a `SprintTask`. Previously
silent paths now write per-task `TaskActivity` rows:

- **Project-task PATCH** delegates to `SprintTaskService.update_task`
  instead of duplicating field assignments, so backlog edits get the
  same per-field timeline (`title_changed`, `priority_changed`, etc.)
  that sprint tasks have.
- **Project-task status PATCH** writes a per-task `status_changed` row
  in addition to the workspace `EntityActivity` it already emitted.
- **Attachment upload + delete** write `attachment_added` /
  `attachment_removed` rows attributed to the actor; affects sprint
  AND project tasks (this was missing for both).
- **Archive / unarchive / remove** write `archived` / `unarchived`
  rows; `actor_id` threaded through `archive_task`, `unarchive_task`,
  and `remove_task` on the service.
- **Sprint moves** (project PATCH inline `sprint_id`, the dedicated
  `move-to-sprint` endpoint, and `bulk_move_to_sprint`) write
  `sprint_changed` with prior and new sprint IDs.
- **Planning-poker finalize** writes a `points_changed` row when the
  estimate it stamps onto each task differs from the prior value.
- **Project-task creation** writes a `created` row so backlog
  timelines start with "X created this task" instead of empty.

`TaskActivityAction` extended with `attachment_added`,
`attachment_removed`, `archived`, `unarchived`, and `sprint_changed`,
with renderer cases in both task modals.

### Fixed

#### Project-task creation silently dropped dates and estimated hours
`POST /teams/{team_id}/tasks` accepted `start_date`, `end_date`, and
`estimated_hours` in `ProjectTaskCreate` but the handler instantiated
`SprintTask(...)` without passing them through, so a fresh task always
saved with NULL dates and NULL hours regardless of the form. The
frontend create path mirrored the drop —
`useProjectBoard.addTaskMutation` explicitly listed each forwarded
field and the dates/hours weren't in the list. Wired all three fields
through every layer (SprintTask kwargs in the backend, mutationFn type
and forwarding, and the `create` and `addTask` API client signatures).

#### Project-task PATCH silently dropped four fields
The same route accepted `start_date`, `end_date`, `estimated_hours`,
and `contributes_to_goal` in `SprintTaskUpdate` but the inline
update in `project_tasks.py:update_task` only handled
title/description/story_points/priority/status/labels/epic_id/sprint_id/
assignee_id/mentions. Editing dates or hours on a backlog task looked
successful but nothing persisted. Added the four missing assignments
with `model_fields_set` semantics on the date and hours fields so
callers can clear them by sending explicit null; `contributes_to_goal`
is non-nullable on the model and stays "set when explicitly provided."

#### Project-task responses omitted attachments and seven other fields
`task_to_response` was duplicated across `sprint_tasks.py` and
`project_tasks.py` and the project-tasks copy was missing
`attachments`, `work_started_at`, `cycle_time_hours`,
`lead_time_hours`, `contributes_to_goal`, `start_date`, `end_date`,
and `estimated_hours`. Result: uploading an attachment to a backlog
task succeeded server-side, but when the UI re-fetched the task via
the project-task list/get/update endpoints, the response serialized
`attachments: []` and stale nulls for dates/hours. Extracted the
canonical builder into a new
`backend/src/aexy/services/sprint_task_response.py` and pointed both
routers at it, so the response shape stays in lockstep going forward.

#### Sprint-task PATCH silently dropped `description_json`
The mirror bug on the sprint-scoped route: `data.description_json`
came in via Pydantic but `task_service.update_task` had no parameter
for it, so the rich-text representation never updated even when the
plain `description` did. Added a sentinel-typed `description_json`
parameter to `SprintTaskService.update_task` (with no activity-log
entry — `description_changed` already covers that), and pass it
through from the sprint-tasks PATCH handler.

#### Aligned frontend update types with the backend schema
`sprintApi.updateTask`, `projectTasksApi.update`, and
`useProjectBoard.updateTaskMutation` had TypeScript signatures that
omitted `start_date`, `end_date`, `estimated_hours`, and
`contributes_to_goal`. The runtime axios call still sent them
(JavaScript is permissive), but the types misled callers. Added the
missing fields so the contract matches the backend.

## [0.7.71] - 2026-05-07

Patch release on top of 0.7.7. Fixes a production-only file-upload
outage, light-mode contrast on the task-create form, and brings the
deployment docs in line with the real stack.

### Fixed

#### Object storage missing from production compose
`docker-compose.prod.yml` had no rustfs (or any S3-compatible) service
and no `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` / `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
env vars on `backend` or `temporal-worker`, even though the dev compose
ships rustfs and points the backend at it. Result: in production
`StorageService.is_configured()` returned False and every file upload —
task attachments, recording uploads, compliance docs — returned `503
File storage is not configured on this deployment`. Added a `rustfs`
service to the prod compose (internal-network only, with healthcheck),
wired the S3 env vars on backend and temporal-worker, added
`rustfs_data` and `rustfs_logs` volumes, added an `/storage/` proxy
location to `nginx/nginx.conf` so uploaded URLs are reachable from the
browser, and seeded `RUSTFS_ROOT_USER` / `RUSTFS_ROOT_PASSWORD` /
`S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL` in `.env.prod.example`. Existing operators
need to set those three values in `.env.prod` and re-run
`docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`.

#### Light-mode contrast on task-create attachment & GitHub-issue buttons
The native `<input type="file">` "Choose files" button on the new-task
form and the secondary "Link issue" button on the GitHub Issues panel
both used `bg-primary-*/10` + `text-primary-200/300` — both very light
blue, which collapses to barely-visible against the form background in
light mode. Reskinned all three controls (two file inputs + the link
button) to the solid `bg-primary-600` + `text-white` style already used
by the primary "+ Link" button, so they pass contrast in both light
and dark mode.

### Documentation

#### New Database Operations guide and stale-reference cleanup
A new `docs/guides/database-operations.md` is now the canonical
reference for everything that touches PostgreSQL: the custom SQL
migration system at `backend/scripts/migrate_*.sql`, manual and
automated backups (the production `aexy-backup` sidecar at 02:00 UTC),
restore from sql dump, restore from volume snapshot, the safe
postgres image-rebuild flow (data on the `postgres_data` named
volume is independent of the image — `down -v` is what kills it),
the major-version upgrade dump-and-reload procedure, and pgvector
specifics. Linked from `docs/README.md`, `DEPLOY.md`, and the
deployment guide.

`DEPLOY.md` and `docs/guides/deployment.md` were brought in line with
the actual stack: the `alembic upgrade head` references became
`python scripts/run_migrations.py`, the Celery / Celery beat /
Flower references became Temporal worker / Temporal UI / Temporal
schedules, the postgres prerequisite is now PG 18 with pgvector
(the bundled `aexy-postgres:18-alpine-pgvector` image) instead of
PG 14/16, and the deployment example compose now includes the
`temporal`, `temporal-ui`, and `temporal-worker` services. The
backup/restore quick-references in both docs now point at the new
Database Operations guide for full procedures.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-05-07

### Added

#### Admin billing breakdown — line-item view of charges, usage, and rates
Workspace owners/admins now have a dedicated breakdown page at
`/settings/billing/breakdown` answering "what am I being charged this
period and why." Platform admins get the same view across every
workspace at `/admin/billing` with a margin column and a click-to-drill
drawer. Both reuse a single `BillingBreakdownView` component so the
shape and behavior stay consistent.

- New `BillingBreakdownService` (`backend/src/aexy/services/billing_breakdown_service.py`)
  composes `LimitsService`, `UsageService`, `PostpaidBillingService`,
  and `StorageQuotaService` into one typed `BillingBreakdown`. Line
  items: base subscription fee, active seats (with included vs
  billable split), LLM usage per provider (tokens, request count,
  rate display), storage usage (informational), plus info counters
  for plan-included free tokens and postpaid accruals. The service
  reads period bounds from `WorkspaceSubscription.current_period_*`
  and falls back to the current calendar month.
- Workspace endpoints `GET /api/v1/billing/breakdown?workspace_id=…&period=current|previous|YYYY-MM`
  and `GET /api/v1/billing/breakdown/history?workspace_id=…&months=6`,
  gated by `verify_workspace_admin`. Margin information is never
  exposed via these routes.
- Platform-admin endpoints under `/api/v1/platform-admin/billing/*`:
  `breakdown`, `breakdown/history`, `summary` (paginated, filterable
  workspace table), and `totals` (revenue, margin, top workspaces,
  plan-tier and billing-model splits). Margin (`base_cost_cents`
  vs `charged_cents` from the snapshotted `UsageRecord` rows) is
  exposed only here.
- `BillingBreakdownView` renders the period header, total/delta cards,
  a category-grouped line-item table with per-item drilldown (provider,
  request counts, base cost when admin), info counters, invoices for
  the period, and a 6-period sparkline. The `delta_cents` /
  `delta_pct` are computed against the prior month's
  `usage_aggregates` row, falling back to live SQL over
  `usage_records` when the aggregate is missing.
- Sidebar entries: `Billing Breakdown` (adminOnly) under Account in
  `settingsNavigation.ts`, and `Billing` in the platform-admin sidebar
  in `(admin)/layout.tsx`.

#### Daily Temporal job to populate billing aggregates
New `aggregate_billing_usage` activity (analysis.py) wired into
`worker.py` and scheduled in `schedules.py` to run every 24h. It
calls `UsageService.update_usage_aggregate` for every active
customer subscription's current period, plus the current and prior
calendar month for every workspace that has any usage. Without this
job the historical breakdown view stays empty in production —
nothing else writes to `usage_aggregates`.

#### Internationalization for the breakdown views
Added `settings.billing.breakdownPage` and `settings.platformBilling`
translation namespaces in `messages/en/settings.json` and
`messages/hi/settings.json`. Every user-facing string in the new
pages and the shared `BillingBreakdownView` component goes through
`useTranslations()`. Plan tier and billing-model labels stay in
English in the Hindi translations per project convention.

### Fixed

#### Plan-included free tokens no longer reduce the breakdown total
The breakdown previously emitted a synthetic `free_credit` line item
with a negative subtotal, dropping `total_cents` by an estimated
allowance. The Stripe billing pipeline
(`UsageService.report_workspace_usage_to_stripe`) reports the raw
sum of `UsageRecord.total_cost_cents` with no such deduction —
per-member free quotas live on `Developer.llm_overage_cost_cents`
and never reduce the workspace invoice. The result was that the UI
showed a lower bill than what Stripe charged. The synthetic credit
is now surfaced as `free_tokens_per_member_per_month` and
`llm_tokens_used` info counters plus a computation note explaining
the per-developer scope, so `total_cents` always equals what the
billing pipeline reports.

#### Platform billing summary filters now apply before pagination
`GET /platform-admin/billing/summary` was paginating on the workspace
query first, then dropping rows whose computed `plan_tier` or
`billing_model` didn't match. A filtered request could return an
empty first page even when matches existed on later pages, and the
`total` count reflected only the search filter. The filters are now
pushed into SQL: `plan_tier` joins `Workspace.plan_id → Plan.tier`,
`billing_model` joins `WorkspaceSubscription.workspace_id →
WorkspaceSubscription.billing_model`. `total` reflects the filtered
set, and pagination operates on the filtered query. Workspaces with
no active subscription row are excluded when `billing_model` is set
(they have no canonical workspace-level billing model to filter on);
plan-tier filtering uses the source plan tier and does not consider
workspace plan overrides.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-05-07

### Added

#### Full task activity history
The History tab on the task modal now shows every change to a task —
not just assignment and status — and every change is attributed to the
user who made it. A reviewer can see who created the task, who renamed
it, who shifted the dates, who edited the description, who reassigned
it, and who dragged it across the board, top-to-bottom in the order
events actually happened.

- `SprintTaskService.update_task` now snapshots each field before
  mutation and writes a per-task `TaskActivity` row (`title_changed`,
  `description_changed`, `points_changed`, `priority_changed`,
  `status_changed`, `labels_changed`, `epic_changed`,
  `start_date_changed`, `end_date_changed`,
  `estimated_hours_changed`) for every value that actually changed.
  Description bodies are not stringified into `old_value`/`new_value`
  — only the fact that the description changed is recorded — to keep
  the activity row small for rich-text edits.
- `update_task_status` and `bulk_update_status` now accept an
  `actor_id` and write a per-task activity row attributing the status
  change to the user who dragged the card or clicked the pill.
  Previously the workspace-wide `EntityActivity` feed had this but
  the modal's History tab did not.
- `create_task` records the creator on the `created` activity row, so
  the History tab opens with a "X created this task" line instead of
  silently starting at the first edit.
- `TaskActivityAction` union extended in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
  with the six new field-change actions, and the renderer in
  `AssignmentHistoryPanel` (board page) and `ActivityItem` (single
  sprint page) now switches on every action with human-readable
  copy: "renamed to X", "set due date to Y", "cleared estimate", etc.
- The History panel no longer filters out non-assignment events —
  it shows everything, with the actor name on every line.

### Changed

#### Optimistic drag-and-drop on the kanban board
Dropping a task into a new column updates the cache before the
network round-trip, so the card stays where the user dropped it
instead of snapping back to its original column for ~100 ms before
re-rendering. Both `useSprintTasks` (sprint board) and
`useProjectBoard` (workspace tasks) gained `onMutate` /
`onError` / `onSettled` handlers that snapshot the prior cache,
apply the new status optimistically, roll back on failure, and
invalidate on settle. The "snap back, then move" flicker that
made dnd-kit feel laggy is gone.

#### Editable links in task descriptions
TipTap's `Link` extension was switched to `openOnClick: false` in
edit mode (when `readOnly` is false), so single-clicking a link
inside the editor now lands the cursor on it for editing instead
of opening it in a new tab. Cmd/Ctrl+click still opens the link.
In read-only renders (description preview, comment view) plain
clicks open the link as before.

### Fixed

#### Storage object orphaned on task attachment delete
`DELETE /sprints/{sprint_id}/tasks/{task_id}/attachments/{id}` was
removing the `task_attachments` row but leaving the underlying S3
object in RustFS forever, so deleted files kept counting against
the workspace's storage quota. The endpoint now derives the storage
key from the attachment URL via the new
`StorageService.key_from_url` (handles both path-style and the R2
virtual-hosted style), calls `delete_object`, and invalidates the
workspace usage cache via `StorageQuotaService` so the quota meter
catches up immediately.

#### `task.assigned` automation didn't fire on PATCH-based reassignment
Reassigning a task by sending `PATCH /sprint-tasks/{id}` with a new
`assignee_id` updated the row and wrote the assignment activity, but
never dispatched the `task.assigned` automation trigger — only the
dedicated `/assign` endpoint did. So workspace automations subscribed
to `task.assigned` (Slack DMs, Linear sync, etc.) silently missed
every reassignment performed through the task modal's edit flow.
`update_task` now mirrors `assign_task`'s `dispatch_automation_event`
call when the assignee changes.

### Internal

- New helper `_stringify_field` in `sprint_task_service` renders
  TaskActivity field values consistently — `None` stays `None` (so
  the History tab can render "—"), datetimes go through `.isoformat()`,
  and lists join with `, `. Avoids the `"None"` string showing up
  in old/new value cells.
- Removed a vestigial `hasattr(task, "attachments")` guard in
  `task_to_response` — the `attachments` relationship is always
  present on `SprintTask` since the v0.7.4 schema migration.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-05-07

### Added

#### Drive — collaborative file storage with AI tagging
A workspace-wide Drive backed by S3-compatible storage (RustFS in dev),
enriched by an AI metadata pipeline that captions images, tags documents,
and annotates videos with timecoded events from a vision-language model.

- New `drive_files` table with folder hierarchy, soft delete, and per-kind
  rendering hints (file / folder / image / video / audio / pdf / doc).
  Smart Views are filter overlays — they don't move files, they translate
  a JSONB filter to a `file_metadata` join. Migration
  `migrate_drive_v1.sql` is idempotent and adds covering partial indexes.
- New `/workspaces/{ws}/drive/files`, `/folders`, `/files`, `/files/{id}`,
  `/smart-views`, `/files/{id}/annotations`, `/files/{id}/reannotate`,
  and `/usage` endpoints. Multipart upload caps at 500 MB per file and
  2 GB per batch before the plan-level quota check, protecting worker
  memory.
- Drive UI under `/docs/drive`: file grid, smart-view sidebar, hybrid
  search bar, multi-file dropzone, quota banner, and a video player that
  overlays Qwen-VL annotations on the timeline.
- Storage quotas: per-plan `max_storage_gb` (with `-1` for unlimited),
  workspace-level overrides, and a Redis-cached usage rollup spanning
  drive_files, task_attachments, and compliance_documents. Concurrent
  uploads are serialised per-workspace via a Postgres advisory lock so
  two simultaneous uploads can't overshoot the cap.

#### Polymorphic file AI metadata
A single `file_metadata` row per file regardless of where the file lives.
`(source_type, source_id)` is unique across `drive_file`,
`task_attachment`, and `compliance_document`. `file_embeddings` and
`video_annotations` foreign-key to `file_metadata.id`, so a non-Drive
video (e.g. a task attachment) can carry annotations through the same
machinery. Adding a fourth source type is one resolver registration —
no schema change.

- Migration `migrate_file_metadata_v1.sql` creates the schema in a single
  transaction with a GIN index on `ai_tags`/`ai_categories` and an
  ivfflat cosine index on the 1024-dim `embedding` column.
- New `/workspaces/{ws}/files/{source_type}/{source_id}/metadata` and
  `.../reannotate` endpoints — the frontend's universal "Reannotate"
  button posts here regardless of source.
- New `/workspaces/{ws}/search/files?q=…&kinds=…` workspace-wide hybrid
  search: pgvector cosine over `file_embeddings` plus an ILIKE pass over
  `ai_summary` and per-source file names. Cmd+K palette
  (`WorkspaceSearchPalette`) is the user-facing surface.
- New `/workspaces/{ws}/source-files?source_type=…` browse endpoint
  returns a unified file row for any source. The Drive sidebar uses it
  to render virtual cross-source views ("Task attachments",
  "Compliance documents") in the same grid as drive files.

#### Qwen vision + embeddings via the LLM gateway
The gateway grows lazy `vision` and `embeddings` properties selected via
`settings.llm.vision_provider` / `embeddings_provider`. Provider keys
are tracked separately from chat-LLM usage so vision + embedding spend
shows up distinctly in the rate limiter.

- Vision providers: OpenRouter (`qwen/qwen2.5-vl-72b-instruct` by default)
  and local Ollama (any Qwen-VL tag). Both implement `analyze_image` and
  `analyze_video_frames`.
- Embedding providers: OpenRouter (`text-embedding-3-large@1024`) and
  Ollama (`bge-m3`). Both produce pgvector-compatible 1024-dim vectors
  so the two backends are interchangeable.
- New `gateway.embed_batch_limited`, `vision_image_limited`, and
  `vision_video_frames_limited` helpers gate every call through the
  Redis rate limiter. Provider keys: `qwen-openrouter`, `qwen-ollama`,
  `embeddings-openrouter`, `embeddings-ollama`.
- ffmpeg frame sampling for video annotation runs in
  `asyncio.to_thread`, so a multi-minute video doesn't block the worker
  event loop.

#### Admin Plans & Overrides editor
A super-admin UI under `/admin/plans` to inspect plans, edit
per-workspace overrides, and kick off the AI metadata backfill for
existing rows.

- Backfill endpoint enqueues a Temporal workflow per workspace that
  scans uncovered drive_files, task_attachments, and compliance_docs
  and dispatches the AI pipeline at the configured rate. The button
  is idempotent — re-clicking finds the running workflow rather than
  starting a parallel one.

### Changed

#### LLM gateway settings moved under `settings.llm.*`
`vision_provider`, `vision_model`, `embeddings_provider`,
`embeddings_model`, and `embeddings_dim` now live under the `LLMSettings`
group instead of the root `Settings`. Existing `VISION_PROVIDER` /
`EMBEDDINGS_*` env vars continue to work.

#### Drive registered in the app catalogue
Added to both `frontend/src/config/appDefinitions.ts` and
`backend/src/aexy/models/app_definitions.py` so it shows up in app-bundle
permission templates and the sidebar layout filter.

#### `DriveFile` is no longer the home of AI metadata
`ai_status`, `ai_summary`, `ai_tags`, `ai_categories`, and
`ai_processed_at` were removed from `drive_files` and the `DriveFile`
TypeScript interface. AI metadata is now read from `file_metadata` via
the polymorphic endpoint or the `useFileMetadata` hook. `FileCard` fetches
its own AI metadata per row, which means task_attachment and
compliance_document files render with the same AI badges in the Drive
grid.

#### Drive-specific search dropped
`GET /workspaces/{ws}/drive/search` and `driveApi.search` are gone.
Callers use the workspace-wide `/search/files?kinds=drive_file` endpoint
(via `useDriveSearch`, which adapts the response to the legacy hit
shape so the UI didn't have to change).

### Fixed

- **Server boot crash from stale module references.** Several legacy
  imports survived the polymorphic-metadata refactor — `DriveFileEmbedding`
  in `drive_search_service`, `VideoAnnotation.file_id` in `drive_service`,
  and a `max_storage_gb` default placed before required dataclass fields
  in `EffectivePlan`. Each one raised at module-import time, taking down
  the entire FastAPI app on startup. All cleaned up; `drive_search_service`
  was removed entirely (replaced by the cross-source `file_search_service`).
- **Gateway vision/embedding settings raised AttributeError.** The
  gateway was reading `settings.vision_provider` etc. off the root
  `Settings`, but those fields had been moved to `LLMSettings`. First
  call to `gateway.vision` or `gateway.embeddings` crashed.
- **Workspace-wide file_name search produced wrong rows.** The `_scan`
  helper's `select(FileMetadata).join(FileMetadata, …)` re-joined
  `FileMetadata` onto itself; the source table was never in the FROM
  clause. Now starts from the source table and joins `file_metadata`
  correctly.
- **Folder cycle detection only caught direct self-parenting.** Moving
  folder A under one of its own descendants (A → … → D → A) silently
  succeeded and corrupted the tree. Now walks the parent ancestry and
  rejects on collision.
- **None-gateway 500.** When `get_llm_gateway()` returned `None`
  (misconfigured or no API keys), `FileSearchService` and the Drive
  search route called `gateway.embeddings` and crashed. Both now accept
  `Optional[LLMGateway]` and degrade to keyword-only search.
- **Mutable default `BackfillStartRequest()`** in the admin backfill
  route replaced with `Body(default_factory=BackfillStartRequest)`.

### Security

- **SSRF guard on the file AI pipeline's `_download_bytes`.** URLs must
  match an allowlisted host suffix (`.amazonaws.com`, `.cloudfront.net`,
  `.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`, `.aexy.io`) or the configured
  `s3_endpoint_url`. After DNS resolution, every returned IP is checked
  against private / loopback / link-local / multicast / reserved /
  unspecified ranges, defending against DNS rebinding attacks where a
  "public" hostname resolves to `169.254.169.254` or RFC1918. Storage
  endpoints matched verbatim skip the IP check by design (ops controls
  those names; they often resolve privately). `follow_redirects=False`
  prevents 30x bypass.
- **IDOR fix on cross-source reannotate.** The
  `/workspaces/{ws}/files/{source_type}/{source_id}/reannotate` endpoint
  used to dispatch the LLM pipeline without verifying that `source_id`
  belonged to `workspace_id`. Any workspace member could trigger
  reprocessing of any file in any workspace by guessing a UUID, charging
  the LLM bill to the wrong tenant. Now resolves the source row and
  rejects with 404 when the workspace doesn't match.
- **Storage quota TOCTOU race.** Two concurrent uploads from the same
  workspace could both pass the cached usage check and overshoot the
  cap by ~2× the incoming bytes. `assert_storage_available` now wraps
  the check in `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended(workspace_id, 0))`
  and reads the used-bytes total fresh from the DB inside the lock.

### Performance

- **Source-files browse covering indexes** (migration
  `migrate_source_files_idx_v1.sql`):
  - `idx_drive_files_workspace_uploaded` on
    `(workspace_id, uploaded_at DESC)` partial
    `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND kind <> 'folder'` — covers the exact
    scan the endpoint runs and skips the sort step.
  - `idx_task_attachments_task_uploaded` on `(task_id, uploaded_at DESC)`
    — speeds the join-then-sort pattern when listing all task
    attachments in a workspace.
  - `compliance_documents` already had `(workspace_id, created_at DESC)`
    from `migrate_compliance_documents.sql` — no new index needed.

### i18n

- New `messages/en/drive.json` and `messages/hi/drive.json` cover the
  Drive UI: ~65 keys across `drive.page`, `drive.fileCard`,
  `drive.upload`, `drive.quota`, `drive.smartView`, `drive.video`,
  `drive.aiBadges`, `drive.metadataPopover`, `drive.metadataSidecar`,
  and `drive.search`. ICU placeholders ({count}, {percent}, {used},
  {limit}, {incoming}) match across both locales.

### Tests

- New Playwright e2e specs: `drive-quota.spec.ts`,
  `drive-smart-views.spec.ts`, `drive-upload.spec.ts`,
  `compliance-doc-ai-sidecar.spec.ts`, `task-attachment-ai-tags.spec.ts`,
  `workspace-search-palette.spec.ts`, `admin-backfill.spec.ts`,
  `admin-plans-edit.spec.ts`. Shared `e2e/fixtures/drive-mock-data.ts`
  fixture seeds files, smart views, AI metadata, and quota state.

### Internal

- `.gitignore` extended for `frontend/playwright-report/`,
  `frontend/test-results/`, `frontend/e2e/debug-screenshot*.png`, and
  `REVIEW_*.md`. The previously-tracked `playwright-report/index.html`
  was removed from the index.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-05-06

### Added

#### Task attachments, schedule, and over-estimate detection
Sprint tasks now carry a scheduled timeline and uploaded files, and the
board surfaces when work has slipped.

- Added `start_date`, `end_date`, and `estimated_hours` columns to
  `sprint_tasks`, plus a new `task_attachments` table with cascade delete.
  Migration `migrate_sprint_tasks_v3.sql` is idempotent and indexes
  `end_date` and `task_id`.
- Added `POST/GET/DELETE /sprints/{sprint_id}/tasks/{task_id}/attachments`
  endpoints. Multipart uploads stream through the existing S3-compatible
  storage service (RustFS).
- AddTaskModal gains datetime-local inputs for start/end, an estimated
  hours field, and a multi-file uploader. Files are uploaded after the
  task is created so cascade delete cleans up cancelled flows.
- EditTaskModal mirrors the new fields and renders an attachment list
  with download links and delete actions.
- Kanban cards render an `Overdue` badge when `end_date` has passed and
  the task is not done, and an `Over estimate` badge when actual cycle
  time exceeds `estimated_hours`. Both are pure-frontend computations.

#### Assignment history visible in the task modal
The EditTaskModal grows a History tab showing the full reassignment
chain so reviewers can see who originally assigned a task and every
hand-off in between.

- `assign_task`, `unassign_task`, and the assignee branch of
  `update_task` now write both old and new assignee IDs into the
  per-task `TaskActivity` stream and the workspace-wide
  `EntityActivity` feed.
- The History panel filters activities to assignment and status events,
  resolves participant names from workspace members, and renders them
  oldest-first so the chain reads in the order it actually happened.

### Changed

#### Whole task card is draggable on the kanban board
Drag-and-drop listeners moved from the small `GripVertical` handle onto
the `TaskCardPremium` root, so the entire card body initiates a drag.
The grip icon remains as a visual affordance. Interactive children
(menu, checkbox, quick-status, archive, quick-edit) stop pointer-down
propagation so clicks on them no longer initiate a drag.

### Fixed

#### Links in task descriptions are clickable after saving
The TipTap `Link` extension now uses `openOnClick: true` with
`target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"`, so URLs
typed into a task description open in a new tab on click instead of
being inert.

### Tests

- Added six Playwright e2e specs covering: attachment upload during
  task creation with start/end dates and estimated hours; the Overdue
  badge; the Over estimate badge; the assignment history chain; the
  whole-card drag affordance; and clickable links in saved
  descriptions. A shared `task-test-helpers.ts` fixture sets up the
  board mocks for all of them.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-04-27

### Added

#### Task modal GitHub PR linking
Task modals now link to real synced GitHub pull requests instead of the
old placeholder `pr_references` field.

- Added sprint task API endpoints to search workspace pull requests, list
  task GitHub links, manually link a PR, and unlink an existing PR.
- The task modal now shows linked PRs with repository, number, title,
  state, and outbound GitHub links.
- Added a searchable PR picker with explicit link/unlink actions and
  loading/error feedback through React Query mutations.
- Added Playwright coverage for opening a task modal from a board deep
  link, displaying existing PR links, linking a synced PR, and unlinking
  an existing PR.

#### Task modal GitHub issue linking
Tasks can now connect to GitHub issues from the project board.

- Added GitHub issue link metadata to `task_github_links` with repository,
  issue number, title, state, and URL.
- Added issue search/link/unlink APIs for both sprint tasks and project
  backlog tasks.
- Added GitHub issue repository context APIs so task modals can explain
  which repo will be used for bare `#123` references.
- Added task title/description auto-linking for explicit `owner/repo#123`
  references and GitHub issue URLs. Bare `#123` links only when the
  project has a single imported GitHub issue repository.
- The task modal now shows linked GitHub issues separately from PRs and
  supports manual issue linking from imported GitHub issues.
- The task modal now supports manual repo override for cross-repo issue
  links using `owner/repo`, `#123`, `owner/repo#123`, or full GitHub
  issue URLs.
- Extended Playwright coverage to verify auto-linked issues, manual issue
  linking, cross-repo issue override, and issue unlinking.

### Fixed

#### Task modal close behaviour on deep links
Closing a task modal opened from `/sprints/{projectId}/board?task=...`
now removes only the `task` query parameter and prevents the modal from
immediately reopening while the route updates. The same modal path is
used from the board and deep-link entry points.

### Changed

#### Task modal polish
Refined the task modal into a wider, more deliberate editing surface:
status changes are saved explicitly, unsaved edits prompt before closing,
dialog accessibility metadata was added, and the GitHub PR section now
lives in the main task content area.

---

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-14

### Added

#### Microsoft (Entra ID) login — parallel to Google sign-in
Added direct Microsoft 365 / Entra ID sign-in alongside the existing
Google flow. Tenant defaults to `common` so both personal (`@outlook.com`,
`@hotmail.com`) and work/school accounts can sign in.

- Three endpoints: `GET /api/v1/auth/microsoft/login` (basic profile + email),
  `/auth/microsoft/connect-crm` (adds Mail + Calendar via Graph), and
  `/auth/microsoft/callback`. Two-scope split mirrors Google.
- New `MicrosoftConnection` SQLAlchemy model and migration
  (`migrate_2026_04_14_microsoft_connections.sql`), parallel to
  `GoogleConnection`.
- `DeveloperService.get_or_create_by_microsoft` with scope-merge rule:
  a subsequent basic login never clobbers tokens that already hold
  `Mail.Read` / `Calendars.ReadWrite`.
- Graph `/me` user info uses `mail` with `userPrincipalName` fallback
  (personal accounts return `mail: null`).
- Profile fields (email / display name / avatar) resync every time the
  user signs in, so Azure AD changes propagate.
- Frontend: "Continue with Microsoft" button + MS lockup icon in the
  two CTA blocks on the landing page.
- 16 integration tests covering service scope-merge, redirect URL shape,
  state validation, happy-path callback with mocked Graph responses,
  and the personal-account `userPrincipalName` fallback.

#### Refresh-token rotation for Google + Microsoft OAuth
New `aexy.services.oauth_token_service` centralises refresh-token
behaviour for every OAuth-holding row type (developer connections,
workspace Google integrations, booking calendar connections). Three
ad-hoc copies of the refresh flow (`gmail_sync_service`,
`calendar_sync_service`, `booking/calendar_sync_service`, and
`api/chat.py`) have been retired — they each had the same two bugs:
rotated refresh tokens were silently dropped, and every non-200
response was treated as "please reconnect" without distinguishing
`invalid_grant` from a transient 5xx.

- `ensure_valid_google_token(db, GoogleConnection)`,
  `ensure_valid_microsoft_token(db, MicrosoftConnection)`,
  `ensure_valid_google_integration_token(db, GoogleIntegration)`, and
  `ensure_valid_calendar_connection_token(db, CalendarConnection)` all
  share two primitives (`_refresh_google`, `_refresh_microsoft`).
- Revocation signalling per model:
  - Nullable `refresh_token` columns are cleared (raises
    `RefreshTokenRevokedError`).
  - `GoogleIntegration.refresh_token` is NOT NULL, so it's marked
    `is_active=False` + `last_error="refresh_token_revoked"`.
  - Booking `CalendarConnection` additionally flips `sync_enabled=False`.
- Microsoft refresh re-requests stored scopes for developer connections
  and the narrow `Calendars.ReadWrite offline_access` pair for booking
  calendars.
- 16 new tests cover rotation, no-op-when-fresh, `invalid_grant`
  clearing, transient 5xx preserving state, scope propagation, and
  the CalendarConnection dispatch-by-provider behaviour.

#### Surface workspace-view picker on the Appearance settings page
The persona/preset selector that filters sidebar sections and chooses
dashboard widgets was previously reachable only via the Dashboard
"Customize" modal. It now also lives at `/settings/appearance`, wired
to the same `useDashboardPreferences` hook so Dashboard and Settings
stay in sync.

#### Create projects inline from /sprints
The `/sprints` empty-state and top action bar now open an inline
project creation modal instead of redirecting to
`/settings/projects`. On create, the user lands directly on
`/sprints/{newProjectId}/board`. The shared
`CreateProjectModal` component is used by both pages.

### Fixed

#### Next.js 16 async dynamic route params
Next 16 made `params` in `[projectId]/board/page.tsx` (and siblings) an
async Promise. Fixed across 12 dynamic routes under `/sprints` and
`/crm/agents`: client components use `React.use(params)`, server
components `await params`.

#### Onboarding: workspace switcher post-onboarding
"Create workspace" link in the sidebar (`WorkspaceSwitcher`) routed to
`/onboarding/workspace`, which the `OnboardingGuard` redirected back to
`/dashboard` for already-onboarded users — making workspace creation
impossible. The guard now lets `/onboarding/workspace` through, stale
`localStorage` state is cleared on visit, and the newly created
workspace is auto-selected via `switchWorkspace()` so the sidebar
updates immediately.

#### Hydration mismatch from the Redeviation browser extension
Added `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>` in the root layout — the
Redeviation DevTools extension injects `data-redeviation-bs-uid` onto
the tag before React hydrates.

#### `create project` / `New project` flow no longer bounces through
`/settings/projects`; it creates the project in-place and jumps to
the new board.

### Changed

#### docker-compose no longer hardcodes LLM env vars
`docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.dev.yml` no longer set
`LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_MODEL`, or any `*_API_KEY` — pydantic reads them
from `backend/.env` by itself. Previously compose set empty strings
that silently shadowed `.env`, so switching providers required editing
compose instead of `.env`. Production compose keeps the injected-via-
shell pattern it was designed for.

#### npm audit vulnerabilities (15 → 0)
`npm audit fix` cleared the 8 non-breaking advisories (critical axios,
high next/rollup/picomatch, moderate brace-expansion/follow-redirects/
markdown-it/next-intl open-redirect). Upgraded vitest 1.2.1 → 4.1.4
to clear the remaining vite path-traversal + esbuild dev-server
issues; tightened `vitest.config.ts` include/exclude so vitest 4's
stricter scanner doesn't pull in Playwright e2e specs from
`.next/standalone/`. Pinned `node-fetch ^2.7.0` via `overrides`
rather than downgrading face-api.js (which `npm audit fix --force`
wanted to do to no actual security benefit).

---

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added

#### DeepSeek as a first-class LLM provider
Added direct DeepSeek API support alongside Claude, Gemini, Ollama, and OpenRouter. DeepSeek uses an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions`) with models `deepseek-chat` (non-thinking DeepSeek-V3.2) and `deepseek-reasoner` (thinking DeepSeek-V3.2).

- New `DeepSeekProvider` with model fallback, 429 `retry-after` handling, usage extraction
- Wired into `LLMGateway` factory + `get_llm_gateway()` bootstrap
- Added `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` and `DEEPSEEK_FALLBACK_MODELS` env vars (defaults to `deepseek-reasoner`)
- Rate-limit knobs: `DEEPSEEK_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `DEEPSEEK_REQUESTS_PER_DAY`, `DEEPSEEK_TOKENS_PER_MINUTE`
- Billing: 28¢/M input, 42¢/M output (cache-miss rate; same for both models)
- Plan tiers updated to include `deepseek` in `llm_provider_access`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_deepseek_provider.py` (12 tests, mocked HTTP)
- Live compatibility harness: `scripts/check_llm_provider.py` — provider-agnostic; runs `health_check` → `call_llm` → `analyze(CODE)` → `extract_task_signals` and reports pass/fail. Use any time a provider or model is swapped.

#### Onboarding: create additional workspaces after initial setup
The sidebar "Create workspace" link routes to `/onboarding/workspace`, but the `OnboardingGuard` was redirecting already-onboarded users back to `/dashboard` — making workspace creation impossible post-onboarding.

- `OnboardingGuard` now allows `/onboarding/workspace` (and `/onboarding/complete`) through for existing users
- Workspace step clears stale localStorage-cached workspace state for already-onboarded users, so they see the "Create / Join" choice instead of "Workspace Ready"
- After create / accept-invite, existing users route to `/dashboard` (instead of `/onboarding/connect`) and the new workspace is auto-selected via `useWorkspace.switchWorkspace()` so the sidebar updates immediately

### Fixed

- Hydration mismatch on `<html>` caused by the Redeviation browser extension injecting `data-redeviation-bs-uid` — added `suppressHydrationWarning` to the root layout

### Changed

- `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.dev.yml` no longer hardcode `LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_MODEL`, or any `*_API_KEY`. LLM config is read from `backend/.env` by pydantic settings — single source of truth. Previously empty-string values in compose silently shadowed `.env`, breaking provider selection. Prod compose (`docker-compose.prod.yml`) continues to inject secrets from the host shell env as designed.

---

### Added

#### Reviews UX/UI Audit & Fixes (20 issues fixed, 30 Playwright E2E tests)
Comprehensive UX/UI audit of the Performance Reviews feature with screenshot-driven TDD fixes.

- **P0 Fixes**: "Active Unknown" bug, date validation on cycle creation, disabled button tooltips, AI preview empty states, success toasts on create/delete
- **P1 Fixes**: Styled delete confirmation modal (replaces browser `confirm()`), ARIA tab attributes (`role=tablist/tab/tabpanel`), breadcrumb navigation consistency, mobile card view for cycles DataTable, user-facing error toasts on API failures
- **P2 Fixes**: Filter count badges on goals tabs, form label accessibility (`htmlFor`/`id`), live goal card preview on create form, `aria-label` on icon-only buttons, cycle timeline preview with phase markers, `aria-live` regions for screen readers, unified loading spinners to `primary-500`
- **Contributions & Feedback tabs**: Wired up with real data (metrics grid, skills, AI summary, self-review responses, full COIN peer feedback)
- **Onboarding**: Fixed checklist href, added "Create a SMART goal" item to developer/manager presets
- **Audit doc**: `review-screenshots/REVIEW_AI_UX_AUDIT.md` with before/after screenshots

#### Next.js 16 + React 19 Upgrade
- Upgraded `next` from 14.1.0 to 16.2.1, `react`/`react-dom` to 19.x
- Fixed JSX parse error in `CustomFieldTypeManager.tsx` (stricter parser)
- Installed missing `@tiptap/suggestion` dependency
- Defensive null check in `useAppAccess.ts`

#### Internationalization (i18n) with next-intl
Full i18n infrastructure with English + Hindi support across all modules.

- **next-intl**: Cookie-based locale system with middleware, Zustand locale store, and language selector in sidebar
- **20 module message files** per locale (EN + Hindi): common, reviews, sidebar, dashboard, tracking, settings, sprints, insights, crm, hiring, agents, booking, email-marketing, learning, uptime, compliance, admin, marketing, products, pages
- **Per-module JSON files** merged at build time via `npm run i18n:merge` (auto-runs on `prebuild`)
- **~1800+ translation keys** per locale covering all feature modules + homepage + product pages + pricing
- **7 review pages** fully converted to `useTranslations()` — remaining pages can adopt incrementally
- **CLAUDE.md** updated with i18n architecture docs, conventions, and how-to guides

### Changed
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` added with non-conflicting ports for parallel development
- CORS origin added for dev port 3003
- JSONB `server_default` syntax fix in dashboard and CRM models

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

#### OpenRouter AI Provider
OpenRouter is now available as a first-class LLM provider, giving access to 100+ models (Claude, GPT-4o, Llama, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc.) through a single API key.

- **OpenRouterProvider**: Full `LLMProvider` implementation using the OpenAI-compatible chat completions API (`POST /chat/completions`) with Bearer auth, rate limit handling (429 with `retry-after`), and health checks via `/models`
- **Automatic model fallback**: When the primary model is rate-limited or unavailable (429/503), automatically tries the next model in a configurable fallback list — set `OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODELS` (comma-separated) to customize the fallback order
- **Configuration**: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_MODEL` (default: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`), `OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODELS` (default: `google/gemini-2.0-flash,openai/gpt-4o,deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3,meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct`) env vars
- **Rate limiting**: Per-provider Redis-backed rate limits (`OPENROUTER_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `OPENROUTER_REQUESTS_PER_DAY`, `OPENROUTER_TOKENS_PER_MINUTE`)
- **Usage billing**: Configurable token pricing (`OPENROUTER_INPUT_PRICE_PER_MILLION`, `OPENROUTER_OUTPUT_PRICE_PER_MILLION`)
- **Frontend**: OpenRouter added to provider selector with Globe icon, indigo theme, and 5 default models; usage page shows OpenRouter breakdown
- **Docker**: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` passed through in both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`

- **Configuration**: `PLATFORM_ORG_ID` env var — set to a workspace UUID to enable

## [0.6.8] - 2026-03-21

### Added

#### Postmark Email Provider
Postmark is now available as an email provider across all three sending paths — notification emails, campaign/workflow emails, and mailagent domain-aware sending.

- **Backend EmailService**: Added `_send_via_postmark()` method, `is_postmark_configured` property, and Postmark routing in `_send_email()` — set `EMAIL_PROVIDER=postmark` to use for all notification emails
- **Mailagent PostmarkProvider**: Full `EmailProvider` implementation with `send()`, `verify_credentials()`, and native `send_batch()` (up to 500 per call via `/email/batch`)

- **Sprint task import**: Import tasks from external sources into sprint boards

#### Ask AI — Agentic Chat
Integrated AI chat assistant with multi-provider LLM support, server-side tool execution, and streaming responses.

- **Ask AI in chat page**: AI tab in the channel sidebar with conversation list (own + shared), date-grouped history, search, and inline delete
- **Agentic tool loop**: Server-side tool calling with workspace-scoped tools (sprints, tasks, tickets); tool calls streamed to client with status indicators
- **Multi-provider streaming**: SSE streaming via Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini providers through the unified LLM gateway
- **Ask AI in floating widget**: Compact AI chat view in the floating widget with conversation history browsing, share button, and participant avatar stack
- **Conversation sharing**: Share AI conversations with workspace members via direct add (with permission levels: read/write/owner) or share links (token-based, optional password, expiry, max uses)
- **Real-time collaboration**: Redis pub/sub for participant presence, AI lock to prevent concurrent responses, message queue for collaborative conversations
- **Share notifications**: In-app notifications when added as participant or when someone joins via share link, with click-through navigation to the conversation
- **Notification settings**: Chat category added to notification preferences page with `chat_mention` and `ai_conversation_shared` event types

#### AI Feedback & Benchmarking

- **API tokens settings page**: Token management UI with copy-to-clipboard, delete confirmation, and last-used tracking (debounced to 5-min intervals)

### Fixed

#### Chat Security & Performance
- **Workspace authorization on all chat endpoints**: Added `_check_workspace` membership guard to every chat API endpoint (channels, topics, messages, presence, file upload)
- **Private channel access control**: Added `_check_channel_access` helper enforcing membership checks on topic listing, creation, message listing, and message sending for private channels
- **WebSocket workspace validation**: Reject WebSocket connections from non-workspace-members with close code 4003
- **WebSocket channel isolation**: Relay messages only to subscribers of the target channel
- **Input validation**: `max_length` constraints on all chat message and channel inputs
- **File upload content-type bypass**: Validate actual file content type, not just the declared MIME type
- **File upload extension validation**: Whitelist allowed file extensions; reject SVG uploads to prevent stored XSS
- **Channel update authorization**: Enforce ownership/admin checks on channel mutations
- **Presence status validation**: Reject invalid presence status values (only `online`, `away`, `offline` allowed)
- **Topic listing limit**: Added `LIMIT 200` to prevent unbounded topic queries
- **Service/API commit boundary**: Replaced all `db.commit()` in `ChatService` with `db.flush()`; explicit `await db.commit()` in all mutating API endpoints
- **N+1 query elimination**: Batch methods for inbox and topic queries; atomic `message_count` updates; correlated subqueries for `list_conversations` in Ask AI
- **TOCTOU race conditions**: `IntegrityError` handling for concurrent topic/message creation
- **Auto-scroll fix**: Only auto-scroll when user is already at the bottom of the message list
- **Memory leak fixes**: Clean up Object URLs, typing timeout intervals, and flash-success timeouts on component unmount
- **Stale WebSocket reconnect**: Fix reconnection using fresh token after re-auth
- **React performance**: `React.memo` on `MessageItem`, memoized WebSocket context value, deduplicated `markTopicRead` calls

#### Auth & API Security
- **Dual-session bug**: `get_current_developer_id` now uses the injected DB session instead of creating a separate one via `get_async_session()`
- **Seed migration removed**: Removed insecure seed migration containing hardcoded token hash
- **Hardcoded URLs removed**: MCP page uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` env var instead of hardcoded localhost
- **Sanitized platform admin errors**: Internal exception details no longer exposed in error responses

#### AI Chat Security
- **Conversation ownership enforcement**: Cross-user conversation access blocked at service layer
- **Delete authorization**: Ownership check enforced before conversation deletion
- **Share link revocation authorization**: Ownership verification before revoking share links
- **bcrypt password hashing**: Share link passwords hashed with bcrypt instead of SHA-256
- **Cross-workspace data isolation**: Tools scoped to the requesting user's workspace
- **Sanitized error messages**: Internal error details stripped from SSE error events
- **API key protection**: LLM provider keys never exposed in client-facing responses
- **Pydantic literal validation**: `permission` fields in share schemas use `Literal["read", "write"]` instead of `str`

#### Frontend Security & Stability
- **Duplicate WebSocket eliminated**: `AskAIChatPanel` now uses `useChatWebSocketContext()` instead of creating a second `useChatWebSocket()` connection
- **Open redirect prevention**: Notification click-through validates `action_url` is a relative path (starts with `/`, not `//`)
- **XSS prevention in chat messages**: URL scheme validation (`http:`/`https:` only) before rendering user-provided URLs as `<img>` or `<a>` elements
- **Race condition fix**: `useStreamMessage` accepts override `conversationId` parameter, eliminating unreliable `setTimeout` in widget first-message flow
- **Store subscription optimization**: `useStreamMessage` uses `useAskStore.getState()` for mutations during streaming, preventing cascading re-renders
- **Memoized participant IDs**: `AskShareDialog` wraps `participantIds` Set in `useMemo` for stable dependency tracking
- **Stable effect dependencies**: `MessageThread` queue-flush effect uses ref for `sendMessage` to prevent infinite re-render loops
- **Floating widget hook optimization**: Split into wrapper + inner component so hooks don't run on `/chat` pages
- **Clipboard error handling**: Share link copy wrapped in try/catch with user-facing error toast
- **Delete confirmation**: AI conversation delete requires `window.confirm()` before proceeding

### Changed
- **MCP sidebar placement**: Moved under AI Agents as a sub-item instead of standalone sidebar entry
- **CopyButton extraction**: Duplicated copy-to-clipboard logic extracted to shared `components/ui/copy-button`
- **Delete confirmation UX**: API token delete uses inline Delete/Cancel step instead of browser `confirm()`

### Database Migrations
- `migrate_ask_collaborative.sql` — `ask_conversation_participants` and `ask_share_links` tables for collaborative AI conversations

#### Agent Policy Engine (APE)
Governance layer that evaluates agent tool calls before execution, with audit trail and billing integration.

- **5 policy types**: `tool_block`, `tool_require_approval`, `field_restriction`, `rate_limit`, `token_budget` — workspace-scoped, priority-ordered, per-agent or global
- **Policy evaluation in LangGraph**: Per-tool-call gating in `BaseAgent._process_tools` — blocked calls return `[BLOCKED] reason` as `ToolMessage` so the LLM can adjust
- **Decision audit log**: Every tool call evaluation (allow, block, require_approval, rate_limited) recorded in `agent_policy_decisions` table with confidence context
- **Config change audit**: Append-only `agent_config_audits` table tracks agent create/update/delete/toggle with old/new field diffs
- **Token usage billing**: Agent execution token counts flow through `UsageService.record_usage()` with `analysis_type="agent_execution"`

- **Schema cleanup**: Remove unused Pydantic schemas (`PlanningPokerVote`, `PlanningPokerState`, etc.)

#### Unified Activity Feed Quality
- **`assessment.workspace_id` AttributeError**: Fixed to use `organization_id` (Assessment model doesn't have `workspace_id`)
- **Duplicate ticket comment logging**: Removed copy-pasted `log_activity` block that created 2 entries per comment
- **Internal ticket comment leak**: Skip activity logging for internal notes to prevent existence leak in feed
- **Double-logging in sprints**: Removed API-layer `log_activity` calls where service layer already logs the same operations
- **Missing actor_id in reviews**: Added `current_user` dependency and `actor_id` to `submit_self_review`, `submit_manager_review`, `finalize_review`
- **Extra DB queries in reviews**: Replaced 2-query workspace_id lookups with single JOIN query

#### Notification System Fixes
- **3 broken integrations fixed**: Insights, tracking tasks, and agent mentions now route through `NotificationService` instead of bypassing it
- **Leave type resolution**: Resolve leave type names from DB instead of passing raw UUIDs in notification bodies
- **Template variable formatting**: Format notification titles with template variables (not just body text)

### Changed

### Fixed

#### Critical Bugs
- **Assessment score triggers used wrong ID**: `assessment.workspace_id` did not exist on the Assessment model — changed to `assessment.organization_id` so `score_above`/`score_below` triggers actually fire
- **Ticket reopen detection crashed**: `TicketStatus.OPEN` did not exist in the enum — changed to `TicketStatus.ACKNOWLEDGED`
- **Command palette duplicate ID**: Two entries shared `id: "nav-templates"` causing React key collision — renamed second to `nav-automation-templates`

#### Medium Bugs
- **Burndown off-track trigger skipped on existing metrics**: Early return on updated rows bypassed the deviation check — restructured to always evaluate
- **Uptime triggers fired on every check**: SSL expiring and repeated failures had no debounce — SSL now fires at day thresholds (30/14/7/3/1), repeated failures fires at exactly 3 consecutive
- **Webhook test toast misleading**: `onSuccess` always showed success even when `WebhookTestResult.success` was false — now checks the result
- **useAutomations registry hooks caused re-renders**: Normalization created new object references on every render — wrapped in `useMemo`
- **SSO page silent errors**: `loadConfig`, `handleToggle`, `handleDelete` used `try/finally` with no catch — added error handling with toast notifications
- **SSO page stale closure**: `useEffect` missing `loadConfig` in dependency array — wrapped in `useCallback`
- **SSO API swallowed all errors**: `getConfiguration` caught everything and returned null — now only catches 404
- **Exports page bypassed type safety**: `createExport(data as any)` — replaced with proper type assertion
- **Webhooks page null workspace**: `currentWorkspaceId!` non-null assertion could produce `/workspaces/null/` API calls — added guard

#### Code Quality
- **Hiring dispatch error handling**: Wrapped `candidate.rejected`/`candidate.hired` dispatch calls in try/except for consistency
- **CRM `between` operator**: Added ValueError/TypeError handling for non-numeric values
- **GlobalShortcuts cleanup**: Dynamic event listener and timeout now properly cleaned up on unmount
- **UpgradeBanner dismiss persistence**: Dismiss state now saved to localStorage, survives navigation
- **WorkspaceChecklist JSON.parse safety**: Wrapped in try/catch to handle corrupted localStorage
- **ModuleAutomationsPanel confirm dialog**: Replaced native `confirm()` with styled confirmation modal
- **Dead code removal**: Removed unused `workspaceId` prop from CommandPalette, unused `useAuth` import from SSO page

#### Accessibility

- **Module-aware trigger icons**: TriggerNode now displays context-specific icons for all 10 modules (tracking: ClipboardCheck/Timer/ShieldAlert, compliance: GraduationCap/BookOpen/Award, tickets: Ticket, hiring: UserPlus, etc.) instead of generic Zap
- **Tracking & compliance objects in config panel**: Added object type selectors for tracking (Standup, Time Entry, Blocker, Work Log) and compliance (Training, Assignment, Certification, Audit Log) modules
- **Trigger description in config panel**: Clicking a trigger node now shows the full description in italic below the label field
- **Complete trigger/action label coverage**: Added labels for all missing triggers (`standup.streak`, `time_entry.anomaly`, `blocker.pattern_detected`, `training.bulk_overdue`, `certification.prerequisite_unmet`, etc.) and actions across all modules

## [0.5.5] - 2026-02-13

### Added

#### All-Contributors Sync

Extended GitHub sync to capture all contributors' commits, PRs, and reviews — not just the connecting user. External contributors are auto-created as "ghost" Developer records.

**Backend:**
- New model fields: `author_github_login` and `author_email` on `Commit` for preserving original author identity
- New helpers: `_resolve_developer_for_commit()` and `_resolve_developer_for_pr()` in `SyncService` to match or auto-create Developer records by GitHub ID or email
- In-memory developer lookup cache within each sync session to avoid N+1 queries
- Removed `author=github_username` filter from `_sync_commits_with_session()` — now fetches all commits
- Removed `login != github_username` filter from `_sync_pull_requests_with_session()` and `_sync_reviews_with_session()`
- Migration: `migrate_commit_author_fields.sql` — adds `author_github_login`, `author_email` columns with indexes

**Ghost Developer Support Across Insights:**
- New helper: `_get_all_contributor_ids()` in `developer_insights.py` — discovers external contributors by querying commits/PRs/reviews in workspace repos
- Leaderboard, team insights, executive summary, and all 6 AI insight endpoints (team narrative, sprint retro, trajectory, root cause, composition, hiring forecast) now include ghost developers
- Ghost developers appear in all rankings, comparisons, and AI-generated narratives alongside workspace members

#### Metric Explanation Tooltips

Added hover tooltips with explanations across all insights pages.

**Compare Page (`/insights/compare`):**
- Info icon + CSS hover popover on each row in the Side-by-Side Metrics table (commits, PRs merged, merge rate, cycle time, lines added, review rate, health score, focus time)
- Radar chart axis labels show native browser tooltips via SVG `<title>` element
- Extended `RadarDataPoint` interface with optional `desc` field
- New `CustomAngleTick` component in `MetricsRadar.tsx` for tooltip-enabled axis labels
- `RADAR_METRICS` config includes `desc` for each metric

**Executive Dashboard (`/insights/executive`):**
- Org Health metrics: Gini Coefficient, Workload Balance, Avg Commits/Dev, Avg PRs/Dev
- Burnout Risks: WE (weekend commit %) and LN (late night commit %) with explanations
- Bottlenecks: explanation of the 2x average threshold

### Fixed

#### Developer Names Instead of UUID Hashes

Multiple insights pages displayed truncated UUIDs (e.g., `8f983e00-386...`) instead of developer names.

- **Compare page** — dropdown items, selected pills, radar chart legends, heatmap labels, and table headers now show developer names via `devNameMap` lookup
- **Executive dashboard** — top contributors table, burnout risks, and bottlenecks now show `developer_name` from API
- **Sprint capacity** — per-developer breakdown table now shows `developer_name` from API
- Added `developer_name` field to backend responses: `compute_executive_summary()`, `estimate_sprint_capacity()`
- Updated TypeScript interfaces: `ExecutiveSummaryResponse`, `SprintCapacityDeveloper`

#### Developer Detail Page Crash

Fixed `/insights/developers/[id]` crashing on gaming flags section due to API schema mismatch.

- Backend returns `{type, severity, description, evidence(object)}` but frontend expected `{pattern, severity: "low"|"medium"|"high", evidence: string}`
- Fixed with `Record<string, unknown>` type and proper field fallbacks (`flag.type || flag.pattern`, severity includes "warning")
- Added optional chaining for `flag.pattern?.replace()` to prevent `TypeError`

#### Analytics Dashboard Broken Joins

Fixed `analytics_dashboard.py` using stale `CodeReview.pull_request_id` column (renamed to `pull_request_github_id`).

- Updated two join clauses to use `CodeReview.pull_request_github_id == PullRequest.github_id`
- Fixed `conftest.py` test fixture using the same stale field name

#### Ghost Developer Creation for PRs/Reviews

`_resolve_developer_for_pr()` now auto-creates ghost Developer records (by GitHub login) when no existing developer matches, consistent with `_resolve_developer_for_commit()` behavior.

### Changed

- Bumped frontend version from `0.5.4` to `0.5.5`
- Moved inline `from sqlalchemy import or_` to top-level import in `developer_insights.py`

## [0.4.4] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed

#### Slack Notification Bug for Uptime Monitors

Fixed an issue where Slack notifications were not being sent for uptime monitor incidents when the monitor didn't have a specific `slack_channel_id` configured.

**Root Cause:**
- Notifications required `monitor.slack_channel_id` to be set, but most monitors relied on the workspace's default Slack channel configuration
- The code didn't fall back to looking up the workspace's configured Slack channel from `slack_channel_configs`

**Changes:**
- Added fallback logic to look up workspace notification channel when monitor-specific channel is not set
- Auto-add `slack` to `notification_channels` when creating new monitors if Slack is configured for the workspace
- Auto-add `slack` to existing monitors when a Slack channel is first configured for a workspace

### Improved

#### Code Quality & Maintainability

**Centralized Slack Integration Helpers:**
- Created new `backend/src/aexy/services/slack_helpers.py` module with shared functions:
  - `get_slack_integration_for_workspace()` - finds integration by workspace/org ID
  - `get_slack_channel_config()` - gets channel config for an integration
  - `get_workspace_notification_channel()` - combines both to get channel ID
  - `check_slack_channel_configured()` - boolean check for Slack setup
- Removed duplicated Slack lookup logic from `uptime_service.py` and `uptime_tasks.py`

**Added Constants for Notification Channels:**
- `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_SLACK = "slack"`
- `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_WEBHOOK = "webhook"`
- `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_TICKET = "ticket"`
- Replaced magic strings throughout the codebase

**Improved Type Safety:**
- Added proper type hints (`db: AsyncSession`) to notification helper functions
- Added return type annotations to `_send_slack_notification()`

**Better Exception Handling:**
- Changed broad `Exception` catches to specific `SQLAlchemyError` for database operations
- Added specific `HTTPError` handling for Slack API calls
- Added explicit timeout (30s) to HTTP client for Slack notifications

**Graceful Error Handling:**
- Wrapped `add_slack_to_monitors()` call in try/except to prevent channel configuration failures if monitor update fails
- Logs warning but doesn't fail the primary operation

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/aexy/services/slack_helpers.py` (new)
- `backend/src/aexy/services/uptime_service.py`
- `backend/src/aexy/processing/uptime_tasks.py`
- `backend/src/aexy/api/slack.py`

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed

#### Uptime Module - Nullability & Visibility Fixes

**Monitor Visibility Bug:**
- Fixed monitors not appearing in the UI after creation
- Backend returns array directly for `/monitors` endpoint, but frontend expected `{ monitors: [], total }` format
- Updated API client to normalize response formats across all uptime endpoints

**API Response Format Alignment:**
- `monitors.list()` - Now correctly handles array response from backend
- `incidents.list()` - Now correctly handles `{ items: [] }` response format
- `monitors.getChecks()` - Now correctly handles `{ items: [] }` response format

**Unknown Status Handling:**
- Added `unknown` status support for newly created monitors (before first check runs)
- Added `unknown` to `STATUS_COLORS` in all uptime pages to prevent render crashes
- Added `DEFAULT_STATUS_STYLE` fallback for unrecognized status values

**Null-Safe Data Handling:**
- Added optional chaining (`?.`) when accessing API response properties
- Added fallback to empty arrays (`|| []`) for all list data
- Added error state resets in catch blocks to prevent stale data display
- Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` errors

**Files Updated:**
- `frontend/src/lib/uptime-api.ts` - API response normalization
- `frontend/src/app/(app)/uptime/page.tsx` - Dashboard null safety
- `frontend/src/app/(app)/uptime/monitors/page.tsx` - Monitors list null safety
- `frontend/src/app/(app)/uptime/monitors/[monitorId]/page.tsx` - Monitor detail null safety
- `frontend/src/app/(app)/uptime/incidents/page.tsx` - Incidents list null safety
- `frontend/src/app/(app)/uptime/incidents/[incidentId]/page.tsx` - Incident detail null safety
- `frontend/src/app/(app)/uptime/history/page.tsx` - Check history null safety
