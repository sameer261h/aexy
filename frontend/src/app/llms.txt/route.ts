> Aexy is an open-source (AGPL-3.0), AI-native company operating system. It replaces separate CRM, engineering/project-tracking, workflow, HR, and docs tools with one workspace where teams and governed AI agents share the same context. Self-hostable for free, with a commercial cloud option.

Key facts: agent-native CRM with schema-flexible custom objects and AI-computed fields; sprint/task management with commit and PR auto-linking; uptime and observability alerts that auto-create and auto-resolve tickets; website visitor identification with lead scoring and routing; email sending-domain warming; AI agents governed by policy gates, approvals, and immutable audit logs; docs with a knowledge graph; self-host or cloud deployment.
