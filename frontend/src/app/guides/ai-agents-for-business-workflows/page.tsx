      description="An AI agent for business workflows is an LLM-driven worker that reads your company's real records — CRM, email, tickets, docs — decides what to do, and acts through governed tools. Unlike a chatbot, it completes work; unlike a Zapier chain, it handles ambiguity. This guide covers what agents can automate today, and the governance layer that makes them safe to deploy."

        "Agents differ from rule-based automation by handling unstructured input: an email reply, a support ticket, a meeting note.",
        "Common production workflows: record enrichment, account summaries, reply classification, follow-up drafts, ticket triage, and routed next steps.",
        "Governance is the deciding factor: policy gates (block / require approval / restrict fields / rate-limit / cap token spend) plus an immutable audit log of every tool call.",
        "Agents work best inside a shared data layer — an agent that sees CRM, docs, and workflows together outperforms one scoped to a single tool.",

          paragraphs: [
            "Rule-based automation (Zapier, Make, native workflow builders) is the right tool when the input is structured and the logic is enumerable: 'when a form is submitted, create a row.' It breaks down when the input is a paragraph of prose or the next step depends on context.",
            "Custom code handles anything but costs engineering time to build and maintain, and each workflow is a bespoke integration.",
            "Agents occupy the middle: they handle ambiguity without custom development, but they need two things rule-based tools don't — governance (because they make judgment calls) and context (because judgment requires seeing more than one tool's data). This is why agents embedded in a company OS outperform bolt-on assistants: the agent that drafts your follow-up can see the deal, the support history, and what engineering shipped last week.",

Then graduate to write actions behind approval gates — drafts a human sends, records a human confirms. Remove the gates only where the agent has earned it. Teams that invert this order (full autonomy first, governance later) are the ones that turn agents back off.",
