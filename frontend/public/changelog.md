## [0.5.6] - 2026-02-14

### Added

#### Dynamic Dashboard Widget System

Replaced the hardcoded dashboard layout with a fully dynamic, preference-driven widget rendering system. Widgets now render from `widget_order` and `visible_widgets` stored in user preferences, with drag-and-drop reordering support.

**Widget Extraction (9 new components):**
- `WelcomeWidget` — greeting, GitHub connection status, quick action links
- `QuickStatsWidget` — language count, framework count, avg PR size, work style
- `LanguageProficiencyWidget` — language bars with proficiency scores, commit counts, trends
- `WorkPatternsWidget` — complexity preference, peak hours, review turnaround
- `DomainExpertiseWidget` — domain tags with confidence scores
- `FrameworksToolsWidget` — framework/tool tags with proficiency scores
- `AIInsightsWidget` — composite widget wrapping InsightsCard, SoftSkillsCard, GrowthTrajectory, PeerBenchmark
- `SoftSkillsWidget` — Reviews & Goals section with My Goals and Performance Reviews
- `ComingSoonWidget` — placeholder for unimplemented widget IDs

**Widget Registry (`widgetRegistry.tsx`):**
- Maps 23 widget IDs to React components (developer, engineering manager, and product manager widgets)
- `getWidgetComponent()` helper with ComingSoonWidget fallback
- `isWidgetImplemented()` check for registry membership

**Dashboard Page Rewrite (`page.tsx`):**
- Dynamic rendering from `orderedVisibleWidgets` computed via `widget_order` intersected with `visible_widgets`
- `getWidgetProps()` switch maps widget IDs to their specific data props
- `getWidgetGridClass()` maps widget sizes to CSS grid column spans
- `renderWidget()` skips composite children and renders from registry or ComingSoonWidget
- Edit Layout toggle button (Pencil/Check icons) for entering/exiting drag mode

**SortableWidgetGrid Updates:**
- Changed layout from `space-y-6` vertical stack to CSS grid: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`
- Added `renderableWidgets` filter to skip null renders from composite children
- Drag handle repositioned to `top-2 right-2`

**Customize Modal — Reorder Tab:**
- Added third tab "Reorder" to `DashboardCustomizeModal`
- New `WidgetReorderList` component — dnd-kit vertical list showing widget icon, name, size badge, and drag handle
- Tabs now rendered from data array; description updated

**Enriched Non-Developer Presets:**
- Manager: added `aiAgents`, `upcomingDeadlines`, `recentDocs`
- Product: added `aiInsights`, `aiAgents`
- HR: added `quickStats`, `aiAgents`, `upcomingDeadlines`, `myGoals`
- Support: added `quickStats`, `aiAgents`, `teamOverview`, `myGoals`

- `e2e/fixtures/mock-data.ts` — mock user, preferences, insights, soft skills fixtures
- `e2e/dashboard.spec.ts` — 18 tests across 6 describe blocks:
  - Widget Rendering (7 tests): welcome, quickStats, languageProficiency, workPatterns, domainExpertise, frameworksTools, ComingSoon
  - Widget Ordering (2 tests): order from preferences, only visible widgets rendered
  - Edit Layout Toggle (2 tests): button toggle, drag handles in edit mode
  - Customize Modal (4 tests): three tabs, tab switching, reorder tab content, close
  - Manager Preset (1 test): cross-cutting widgets present

## [0.5.5] - 2026-02-13

### Added

#### All-Contributors Sync

Extended GitHub sync to capture all contributors' commits, PRs, and reviews — not just the connecting user. External contributors are auto-created as "ghost" Developer records.

**Backend:**
- New model fields: `author_github_login` and `author_email` on `Commit` for preserving original author identity
- New helpers: `_resolve_developer_for_commit()` and `_resolve_developer_for_pr()` in `SyncService` to match or auto-create Developer records by GitHub ID or email
- In-memory developer lookup cache within each sync session to avoid N+1 queries
- Removed `author=github_username` filter from `_sync_commits_with_session()` — now fetches all commits
- Removed `login != github_username` filter from `_sync_pull_requests_with_session()` and `_sync_reviews_with_session()`
- Migration: `migrate_commit_author_fields.sql` — adds `author_github_login`, `author_email` columns with indexes

**Ghost Developer Support Across Insights:**
- New helper: `_get_all_contributor_ids()` in `developer_insights.py` — discovers external contributors by querying commits/PRs/reviews in workspace repos
- Leaderboard, team insights, executive summary, and all 6 AI insight endpoints (team narrative, sprint retro, trajectory, root cause, composition, hiring forecast) now include ghost developers
- Ghost developers appear in all rankings, comparisons, and AI-generated narratives alongside workspace members

#### Metric Explanation Tooltips

Added hover tooltips with explanations across all insights pages.

**Compare Page (`/insights/compare`):**
- Info icon + CSS hover popover on each row in the Side-by-Side Metrics table (commits, PRs merged, merge rate, cycle time, lines added, review rate, health score, focus time)
- Radar chart axis labels show native browser tooltips via SVG `<title>` element
- Extended `RadarDataPoint` interface with optional `desc` field
- New `CustomAngleTick` component in `MetricsRadar.tsx` for tooltip-enabled axis labels
- `RADAR_METRICS` config includes `desc` for each metric

**Executive Dashboard (`/insights/executive`):**
- Org Health metrics: Gini Coefficient, Workload Balance, Avg Commits/Dev, Avg PRs/Dev
- Burnout Risks: WE (weekend commit %) and LN (late night commit %) with explanations
- Bottlenecks: explanation of the 2x average threshold

### Fixed

#### Developer Names Instead of UUID Hashes

Multiple insights pages displayed truncated UUIDs (e.g., `8f983e00-386...`) instead of developer names.

- **Compare page** — dropdown items, selected pills, radar chart legends, heatmap labels, and table headers now show developer names via `devNameMap` lookup
- **Executive dashboard** — top contributors table, burnout risks, and bottlenecks now show `developer_name` from API
- **Sprint capacity** — per-developer breakdown table now shows `developer_name` from API
- Added `developer_name` field to backend responses: `compute_executive_summary()`, `estimate_sprint_capacity()`
- Updated TypeScript interfaces: `ExecutiveSummaryResponse`, `SprintCapacityDeveloper`

#### Developer Detail Page Crash

Fixed `/insights/developers/[id]` crashing on gaming flags section due to API schema mismatch.

- Backend returns `{type, severity, description, evidence(object)}` but frontend expected `{pattern, severity: "low"|"medium"|"high", evidence: string}`
- Fixed with `Record<string, unknown>` type and proper field fallbacks (`flag.type || flag.pattern`, severity includes "warning")
- Added optional chaining for `flag.pattern?.replace()` to prevent `TypeError`

#### Analytics Dashboard Broken Joins

Fixed `analytics_dashboard.py` using stale `CodeReview.pull_request_id` column (renamed to `pull_request_github_id`).

- Updated two join clauses to use `CodeReview.pull_request_github_id == PullRequest.github_id`
- Fixed `conftest.py` test fixture using the same stale field name

#### Ghost Developer Creation for PRs/Reviews

`_resolve_developer_for_pr()` now auto-creates ghost Developer records (by GitHub login) when no existing developer matches, consistent with `_resolve_developer_for_commit()` behavior.

### Changed

- Bumped frontend version from `0.5.4` to `0.5.5`
- Moved inline `from sqlalchemy import or_` to top-level import in `developer_insights.py`

## [0.4.4] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed

#### Slack Notification Bug for Uptime Monitors

Fixed an issue where Slack notifications were not being sent for uptime monitor incidents when the monitor didn't have a specific `slack_channel_id` configured.

**Root Cause:**
- Notifications required `monitor.slack_channel_id` to be set, but most monitors relied on the workspace's default Slack channel configuration
- The code didn't fall back to looking up the workspace's configured Slack channel from `slack_channel_configs`

**Changes:**
- Added fallback logic to look up workspace notification channel when monitor-specific channel is not set
- Auto-add `slack` to `notification_channels` when creating new monitors if Slack is configured for the workspace
- Auto-add `slack` to existing monitors when a Slack channel is first configured for a workspace

### Improved

#### Code Quality & Maintainability

**Centralized Slack Integration Helpers:**
- Created new `backend/src/aexy/services/slack_helpers.py` module with shared functions:
  - `get_slack_integration_for_workspace()` - finds integration by workspace/org ID
  - `get_slack_channel_config()` - gets channel config for an integration
  - `get_workspace_notification_channel()` - combines both to get channel ID
  - `check_slack_channel_configured()` - boolean check for Slack setup
- Removed duplicated Slack lookup logic from `uptime_service.py` and `uptime_tasks.py`

**Added Constants for Notification Channels:**
- `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_SLACK = "slack"`
- `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_WEBHOOK = "webhook"`
- `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_TICKET = "ticket"`
- Replaced magic strings throughout the codebase

**Improved Type Safety:**
- Added proper type hints (`db: AsyncSession`) to notification helper functions
- Added return type annotations to `_send_slack_notification()`

**Better Exception Handling:**
- Changed broad `Exception` catches to specific `SQLAlchemyError` for database operations
- Added specific `HTTPError` handling for Slack API calls
- Added explicit timeout (30s) to HTTP client for Slack notifications

**Graceful Error Handling:**
- Wrapped `add_slack_to_monitors()` call in try/except to prevent channel configuration failures if monitor update fails
- Logs warning but doesn't fail the primary operation

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/aexy/services/slack_helpers.py` (new)
- `backend/src/aexy/services/uptime_service.py`
- `backend/src/aexy/processing/uptime_tasks.py`
- `backend/src/aexy/api/slack.py`

- New encryption utility module at `core/encryption.py`

### Changed

- Updated `EmailProvider` TypeScript interface with `credentials`, `description`, `settings`, and status fields
- Updated provider update API to accept `credentials` and `description` parameters
- Added `has_credentials` boolean field to provider API responses for secure credential status indication

### Fixed

- Fixed migration runner `--force` flag not re-running changed migrations
- Fixed TypeScript type errors in provider credential handling
- Fixed provider test not showing results to user (toast notifications now display success/error)
- Fixed "Setup Required" badge not updating after credentials are saved (now uses `has_credentials` from API)

  - SendGrid: checks for `api_key`
  - Mailgun: checks for `api_key` and `domain`
  - Postmark: checks for `server_token`
  - SMTP: checks for `host`

#### Sending Domain Model
- Made `provider_id` nullable in SendingDomain model
- Added `SET NULL` on delete for provider foreign key relationship
- Added `dns_records`, `verification_token`, and `verified_at` fields to SendingDomainListResponse schema

#### Documentation & Website

- Added comprehensive booking module documentation at `/docs/booking.md`
- Added booking product page at `/products/booking`
- Updated `/docs/README.md` to include booking in documentation index
- Updated `/docs/google.md` with booking calendar callback URLs

### Fixed

**Calendar OAuth Flow:**
- Fixed "Method Not Allowed" error when connecting Google/Microsoft calendars
- Refactored to use standard OAuth callback pattern (backend receives redirect)
- OAuth state now signed with HMAC for security
- Proper error handling with user-friendly redirect messages

**Callback URL Change:**
- Old: Frontend received OAuth redirect, then POST to backend
- New: Backend receives OAuth redirect directly at `/api/v1/booking/calendars/callback/{provider}`
- Backend exchanges code for tokens and redirects user to frontend with success/error params

### Changed

- Calendar OAuth redirect URIs now point to backend callback endpoints
- Frontend calendars page handles `?success=true` and `?error=...` query params
