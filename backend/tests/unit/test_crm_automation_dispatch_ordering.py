"""Regression tests for how an automation hands an email to the worker.

Production bug: the send workflow was started inline, inside the still-open
request transaction. The worker reads the run on its own connection, so it
could reach the run before the commit and find nothing - or find the run but
not the step list, which is only written after the action returns. Either way
it logged a warning and returned, leaving the run on "queued" forever with no
CRM activity for the email.

Observed live: six consecutive runs stranded on "queued", every one logging
"No queued email step found" - the second variant, which is what actually
fires in practice.

The fix records the intent to send in the same transaction as the run, so the
row cannot exist unless the run does, and nothing is committed early.
