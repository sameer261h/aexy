"""Cross-process invalidation for the workspace app_settings cache.

The app-toggle guard reads ``workspace.settings["app_settings"]`` on nearly
every request and caches it in-process (see ``app_access_service``). That cache
is per-process, so when an admin toggles a module the writing worker clears its
own copy but other workers/containers keep serving the stale value until the
TTL lapses.

This module closes that gap with a tiny Redis pub/sub channel: writers publish
the changed workspace id, and every worker runs a background subscriber that
drops the matching local cache entry. Everything here is best-effort — if Redis
is unavailable the app still runs and simply falls back to TTL-bounded
staleness.
